## Objective

As the final evaluation for the *Valation* course, students will develop a *Capstone Project* demonstrating their ability to apply the methods discussed in class to evaluate a publicly-traded Brazilian company.  Students will work in groups to conduct a comprehensive valuation, integrating both **relative valuation** and **discounted cash flow (DCF)** approaches, to come up with a final investment recommendation.

Please take some time to review the specific guidelines that should be the basis of your project.

## Project Scope Group Formation

Students must work in teams of up to **five members**, maximum. Each team is responsible for defining roles and organizing their workflow effectively to ensure timely completion. The expected output must be structured containing the following deliverables:

1.  A *PowerPoint* presentation that summarizes the investment recommendation; and
2.  An *Excel* spreadsheet containing the calculations conducted throughout the project


## Step-by-step

The professor will assign each group with a publicly-traded company. Students are expected to complete the following tasks:


**1. Historical Performance Analysis & Relative Valuation**: analyze the company’s historical performance over the past 5 years, including revenue growth, profitability, capital efficiency, and leverage trends:

  - Calculate and compare valuation multiples (e.g., P/E, EV/EBITDA, P/B, EV/Sales) against the peer group
  - Interpret differences between the subject company and its peers

$\rightarrow$ *Students can use [FactSet](https://www.factset.com/marketplace/catalog) to identify and select an appropriate peer group. For details on how to redeem access through *FGV*, follow the instructions outlined on (eClass).*

**2. Calculating Financial Indexes**: using the balance-sheet, income statement, and cash-flow statements, calculate, for the latest 5 (five) fiscal years:

  - *Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT)*
  - *Net Operating Profit After Taxes (NOPAT)*
  - *Free Cash Flow (FCF)*

 Clearly document assumptions and any adjustments (e.g., normalization of earnings, one-off expenses).

**3. Forecasting Free Cash Flows**: project the company’s *Free Cash Flow* for the next **5 years**. State and justify key forecast assumptions (*e.g.*, revenue growth rate, operating margins, reinvestment needs, tax rates, discount rate).

**4. Terminal Value Estimation:** Estimate the (or continuation value) using both the perpetuity growth method or an exit multiple method. Discuss the implications and differences between the two.

**5. Implied share price:** Calculate the firm value, equity value, and the estimated share price using the DCF model

  - Perform **sensitivity analysis** for key inputs (e.g., WACC, terminal growth rate, exit multiple, revenue growth).
  - Present results in tables and charts.

## Evaluation Criteria

The evaluation criteria will be mainly take *two* aspects into consideration: a written report ($50\%$) and a project showcase ($30\%$). First, the written report, will be evaluated on the basis of:

1.  The *quality* and *adherence* of the deliverable relative to the expected goals outlined in the guidelines
2.  The group's ability to *interpret* data using finance theory and *draw insights* from their findings
3.  Organization, providing clean, concise, and reproducible results

Furthermore, at the end of the course, each group is also expected to present their project to the course audience. **All individuals from the group are expected to attend and present**. During this showcase, which should last no longer than *10 (ten) minutes*, students will be evaluated on the basis of:

1.  **Ability to Answer Practical and Technical Questions**
    -   Demonstrate a deep understanding of their analysis, methods, and results
    -   Presenters should be prepared to respond to questions regarding data sources, methodology, and financial interpretation
2.  **Organization**
    -   The project should be well-structured, with a logical flow from problem statement to conclusion
    -   Code and documentation should be clear, well-commented, and reproducible
3.  **Clear Communication**
    -   Presentations should be *concise*, *engaging*, and *accessible* to the audience
    -   Visualizations and explanations should effectively convey key insights

## Expectations & Best Practices

All in all, the *Capstone Project* is an opportunity for students not only to showcase their work not only for the course audience, but also for external audiences, like HR managers, recruiters, among others. At the same time you can expect to receive feedback from your colleagues, be prepared to also provide useful feedback to other groups regarding their work.

To make sure that you are set up for success, try to follow these best practices to best of our ability:

-   **Start early**: effective time management is crucial for success. Make sure to devote enough time for somewhat cumbersome tasks, such as data collection and manipulation
-   **Collaborate efficiently**: distribute tasks within your team to leverage individual strengths. Test code snippets and make sure that the whole analysis is reproducible
-   **Maintain clarity**: ensure that your analysis and conclusions are well-documented and easy to follow
-   **Review and iterate**: test your calculations, validate results, and refine your presentation

## Deadlines

The deadline for the submission of the *Capstone Project* is **Sunday, 28th, at 11:59 PM, Brazilian time**. Submissions made after this date **will not be accepted**. Make sure that one (and only one) member of your group posts the file on *eClass®*.

## Final Thoughts

Students are highly encouraged to share their codes so that everyone can replicate and contribute to their analyses. This capstone project represents an opportunity to apply your knowledge in a meaningful way, demonstrating both technical and analytical skills. Make the most of it!
