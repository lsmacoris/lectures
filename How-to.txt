- We need to use SSH authentication to link RStudio to Github: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Bn78aor_N4
- Create a folder 'lectures'
- Link this folder to a github using the process in the video
- Add in folders with quarto reveal lectures in subfolders
- In the lecture folder, use the terminal and type:

git worktree prune
git checkout main
git add .
git commit -m "Insert the message here"
git push origin


This ensures that the remote repository contains the changes. Now, check to see if the gh-pages branch is there.
You need to delete it from both local and remote:
git branch gh-pages -d
git push origin -d gh-pages

Finally, publish using

quarto publish gh-pages

- It will use the contents from main, render all .qmds and create a gh-pages branch with the rendered content
- The rendered content will be uploaded inside the 'lectures' folder onto xxxx.github.io/lectures.
