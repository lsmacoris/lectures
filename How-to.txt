MANUAL
------------------------------

- We need to use SSH authentication to link RStudio to Github: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Bn78aor_N4
- Create a folder 'lectures'
- Link this folder to a github using the process in the video
- Add in folders with quarto reveal lectures in subfolders
- In the lecture folder, use the terminal and type:

git worktree prune
git checkout main
git add .
git commit -m "Insert the message here"
git push origin


This ensures that the remote repository contains the changes. Now, check to see if the gh-pages branch is there.
You need to delete it from both local and remote:
git branch gh-pages -d
git push origin -d gh-pages

Finally, publish using

quarto publish gh-pages

- It will use the contents from main, render all .qmds and create a gh-pages branch with the rendered content
- The rendered content will be uploaded inside the 'lectures' folder onto xxxx.github.io/lectures.


------------------------------
USING GITHUB PAGES
------------------------------

1. Make sure that the .yaml file refers to the /lectures folder of your sire
2. Set 'output-dir' in the yaml file to refer to the docs folder of your main branch
3. After that, go to GitHub, settings, gh-pages, set 'Deploy from a branch' and refer to main/docs
4. With that, everytime you push a new version of a given .qmd, it will automatically update the /docs file, and it will reflect in the site.

In this way, there is no need to rebuild the site everytime.
