It particularly addresses the fundamentals of capital investment analysis, working capital management, economic-financial analysis of companies, cash generation capacity and its influence on the objective of maximizing shareholder wealth. These approaches will consider the fundamental factors of ESG (Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance) policies and their consequences for companies."

Whenever available, look at market values\n\nMany capital assets are traded in a competitive market, so it makes sense to start with the market price and then ask why you can earn more than your rivals from these assets\nStocks, for example, have both public and private information embedded on their values. Investors have already evaluated the information that is generally known. Security analysts do not need to evaluate this information again, and can concentrate on their private information"

It means that a given investment earns more than it should after factoring its risk\nQuestion: if that is the case, then can we assert that no one else is going to pursue the same project? A couple of thoughts:\n\nNPV goes hand in hand with economic profits. As markets become more competitive, economic rents go down, and so does NPV\nIn a perfect equilibrium, an investment should earn zero NPV - i.e, it would yield only the value that compensates its risks, but no economic rents\n\nThat leaves us with another question: if a given project is actually a positive NPV one, which factors sustain such economic rents so that other players do not erode it?\nA competitive advantage will protect a firm only if it is durable and can be sustained against competition from other businesses!"

Choosing this alternative is equivalent to receiving its NPV in cash today:\n\nIn the case of a stand-alone project, we must choose between accepting or rejecting the project.\nTherefore, the NPV rule then says we should compare the project’s NPV to zero (the NPV of doing nothing) and accept the project if its NPV is positive\n\nLet’s use this rationable to analyze how the NPV rule applies to the Cia Amazônia case. For these exercises, we’ll assume a discount rate (i.e, a cost of capital) of 15%."

    "text": "About the company\n\nIdeko is a privately held designer and manufacturer of specialty sports eyewear based in Chicago\nIn mid-2005, its owner and founder, June Wong, has decided to sell the business, after having relinquished management control about four years ago. As a partner in KKP Investments, you are investigating purchasing the company\nIf a deal can be reached, the acquisition will take place at the end of the current fiscal year. In that event, KKP plans to implement operational and financial improvements at Ideko over the next five years, after which it intends to sell the business\nYou believe a deal could be struck to purchase Ideko’s equity at the end of this fiscal year for an acquisition price of $150 million, which is almost double Ideko’s current book value of equity. Is this price reasonable?"

More specifically, market-valuation multiples rely on the fact that a reasonable estimate for a firm’s value should be a factor of its earnings:\n\nIf the industry-median EV/EBITDA is 3.2x, our firm is valued at…\nIf the industry-median EV/Sales is 1.2x, our firm is valued at…\nIf the P/E ratio is 15x, our firm is valued at…\n\n\n\n\\(\\rightarrow\\) For a more detailed discussion on market-valuation ratios, refer to the Financial Analysis lecture."

The rationale was that managerial expertise was portable across business lines and that the conglomerate business form offered great financial advantages\n1980: “hostile, bust-up” takeovers \\(\\rightarrow\\) acquirers purchased poorly performing conglomerates and sold off its individual business units for more than the purchase price\n1990: “strategic” or “global” deals \\(\\rightarrow\\) more likely to be friendly and to involve companies in related businesses; these mergers often were designed to create strong firms on a scale that would allow them to compete globally\n2000: consolidation \\(\\rightarrow\\) in many industries such as telecommunications and software.

In general, these come from synergies, such as cost reductions, revenue enhancements strategies!"

The commitment fee is 0.5% (EAR). At the beginning of the year, the firm borrows $800,000. It then repays this loan at the end of the year, leaving $200,000 unused for the rest of the year. The total cost of the loan is:\n\n\n(+) Interest on borrowed funds: $800,000 \\(\\times\\) 10% = 80,000\n(+) Commitment on unused portion: $200,000 \\(\\times\\) 0.5% = 1,000\n(=) Total Cost = 81,000\n(=) Effective Interest Rate, inclusive of Fees: (881,000/800,000)-1=10.125%"

This loan has a loan origination fee of 1% charged on the principal.\n\nThe amount of the loan origination fee is \\(1\\% \\times 500,000 = 5,000\\)\nThe actual amount borrowed is \\(500,000-5,000=495,000\\)\n\nThe interest rate is charged on the total, not the discounted value: $500,000 \\(\\times\\) (3%) = \\(15,000\\)\nTherefore, the annual effective interest rate is 515,000/495,000 - 1 = 4.04%"

In that case, the project’s cost of capital can be assessed based on the risk of the firm.\nThe firm’s debt-equity ratio is constant: we consider a firm that adjusts its leverage to maintain a constant debt-equity ratio in terms of market values.\nCorporate taxes are the only imperfection: we assume that the main effect of leverage on valuation is due to the corporate tax shield. Other effects, such as issuance costs, personal costs, and bankruptcy costs, are abstracted away\n\nWhile these assumptions are restrictive, they are also a reasonable approximation for many projects and firms"
