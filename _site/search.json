In that case, the project’s cost of capital can be assessed based on the risk of the firm.\nThe firm’s debt-equity ratio is constant: we consider a firm that adjusts its leverage to maintain a constant debt-equity ratio in terms of market values.\nCorporate taxes are the only imperfection: we assume that the main effect of leverage on valuation is due to the corporate tax shield. Other effects, such as issuance costs, personal costs, and bankruptcy costs, are abstracted away\n\nWhile these assumptions are restrictive, they are also a reasonable approximation for many projects and firms"

In general, such sources have lower transaction costs than short-term sources of funds, which would have to be replaced more often.\n\n\nExample: after forecasting permanent working capital needs, if funding occurs through short-term sources (say, 1 year), firms are exposed to interest rate risk – you may have to refinance at a higher rate in the future! During COVID-19, interest rate risk made smaller firms to shut-down its operations."

This loan has a loan origination fee of 1% charged on the principal.\n\nThe amount of the loan origination fee is \\(1\\% \\times 500,000 = 5,000\\)\nThe actual amount borrowed is \\(500,000-5,000=495,000\\)\n\nThe interest rate is charged on the total, not the discounted value: $500,000 \\(\\times\\) (3%) = \\(15,000\\)\nTherefore, the annual effective interest rate is 515,000/495,000 - 1 = 4.04%"

In general, these come from synergies, such as cost reductions, revenue enhancements strategies!"

More specifically, market-valuation multiples rely on the fact that a reasonable estimate for a firm’s value should be a factor of its earnings:\n\nIf the industry-median EV/EBITDA is 3.2x, our firm is valued at…\nIf the industry-median EV/Sales is 1.2x, our firm is valued at…\nIf the P/E ratio is 15x, our firm is valued at…\n\n\n\n\\(\\rightarrow\\) For a more detailed discussion on market-valuation ratios, refer to the Financial Analysis lecture."

    "text": "The Net Present Value (NPV) rule\n\nWe begin our discussion of investment decision rules by considering a take-it-or-leave-it decision involving a single, stand-alone project.\nNPV Investment Rule: When making an investment decision, take the alternative with the highest NPV. Choosing this alternative is equivalent to receiving its NPV in cash today:\n\nIn the case of a stand-alone project, we must choose between accepting or rejecting the project.\nTherefore, the NPV rule then says we should compare the project’s NPV to zero (the NPV of doing nothing) and accept the project if its NPV is positive\n\nLet’s use this rationable to analyze how the NPV rule applies to the Cia Amazônia case. For these exercises, we’ll assume a discount rate (i.e, a cost of capital) of 15%."

Whenever available, look at market values\n\nMany capital assets are traded in a competitive market, so it makes sense to start with the market price and then ask why you can earn more than your rivals from these assets\nStocks, for example, have both public and private information embedded on their values. Investors have already evaluated the information that is generally known. Security analysts do not need to evaluate this information again, and can concentrate on their private information"

It means that a given investment earns more than it should after factoring its risk\nQuestion: if that is the case, then can we assert that no one else is going to pursue the same project? A couple of thoughts:\n\nNPV goes hand in hand with economic profits. As markets become more competitive, economic rents go down, and so does NPV\nIn a perfect equilibrium, an investment should earn zero NPV - i.e, it would yield only the value that compensates its risks, but no economic rents\n\nThat leaves us with another question: if a given project is actually a positive NPV one, which factors sustain such economic rents so that other players do not erode it?\nA competitive advantage will protect a firm only if it is durable and can be sustained against competition from other businesses!"

It often occurs at such an early stage in the business when it is difficult to assess a value for the firm\nAngel investors often circumvent this uncertainty problem by holding either a convertible note or a SAFE (simple agreement for future equity) rather than equity:\n\nAngel investors may have a share price discount over new investors\nThis allows angels and entrepreneurs to agree on terms without agreeing on a value for the firm, postponing the valuation decision until the firm is more mature and attractive to venture capitalists"

As investors in Series E were willing to pay $8.99 for a share of preferred stock, the valuation of existing preferred stock (earlier rounds) had increased significantly \\(\\rightarrow\\) early investors had substantial capital gains\nBecause Real Networks was still a private company, however, investors could not liquidate their investment by selling their stock in the public stock markets!\nHow can investors realize the return from their investment in terms of an exit strategy? This happens mainly through:\n\nAcquisitions: often, large corporations acquire startups by purchasing the outstanding stock of the private company, allowing all investors to cash out their investment and gains\nGoing public: a firm can also become a public traded company through a Initial Public Offering, allowing shareholders to publicly negotiate their shares\n\nIn the next session, we’ll focus on the latter exit strategy"

Most common.\nAuction: A method of selling new issues directly to the public rather than setting a price itself and then allocating shares to buyers, the underwriter in an auction IPO takes bids from investors and then sets the price that clears the market."
