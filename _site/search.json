The most common choices are financing through equity alone and financing through a combination of debt and equity\nAs a result, the Capital Structure decision of a firm is the relative proportion of debt, equity, and other securities that a firm has outstanding constitute its capital\nFinancial Managers are often faced with the challenge of choosing the proportions of debt and equity of the firm\n\nWhen it comes to Capital Structue, a central question is: do capital structure decisions affect firm value?\nPut another way, is there an optimal Capital Structure that maximizes the value of a firm?\n\n\n\n\\(\\rightarrow\\) As we’ll see throughout this lecture, under some conditions, the value of a firm is not affected by its capital structure decisions!"

Whenever available, look at market values\n\nMany capital assets are traded in a competitive market, so it makes sense to start with the market price and then ask why you can earn more than your rivals from these assets\nStocks, for example, have both public and private information embedded on their values. Investors have already evaluated the information that is generally known. Security analysts do not need to evaluate this information again, and can concentrate on their private information"

A couple of thoughts:\n\nNPV goes hand in hand with economic profits. As markets become more competitive, economic rents go down, and so does NPV\nIn a perfect equilibrium, an investment should earn zero NPV - i.e, it would yield only the value that compensates its risks, but no economic rents\n\nThat leaves us with another question: if a given project is actually a positive NPV one, which factors sustain such economic rents so that other players do not erode it?\nA competitive advantage will protect a firm only if it is durable and can be sustained against competition from other businesses!"

In the book-store example, all potential projects fully exhaust the resource constraint (i.e, there is only one property available that will be 100% used for the chosen project)\nWhat if different projects demand different amounts of a particular scarce resource? For example, different products may consume different proportions of a firm’s production capacity, or might demand different amounts of managerial time and attention"

Which assumption of the strategy described to bring the TATO to the industry benchmark can be violated if the CFO chooses Option 1?\n\n\nA: even assuming that PPE and Inventories can be liquidated at book value, the assumption that sales will not be affected by the strategy can not hold. Since PPE and Inventories are, in general, actively used in the firm’s operations, reducing the amount of operational assets can negatively impact sales."

In that event, KKP plans to implement operational and financial improvements at Ideko over the next five years, after which it intends to sell the business\nYou believe a deal could be struck to purchase Ideko’s equity at the end of this fiscal year for an acquisition price of $150 million, which is almost double Ideko’s current book value of equity.

More specifically, market-valuation multiples rely on the fact that a reasonable estimate for a firm’s value should be a factor of its earnings:\n\nIf the industry-median EV/EBITDA is 3.2x, our firm is valued at…\nIf the industry-median EV/Sales is 1.2x, our firm is valued at…\nIf the P/E ratio is 15x, our firm is valued at…\n\n\n\n\\(\\rightarrow\\) For a more detailed discussion on market-valuation ratios, refer to the Financial Analysis lecture."

While forecasting cash flows explicitly is useful in capturing those specific aspects of a company, in the long run firms in the same industry typically have similar expected growth rates, profitability, and risk\nThus, applying a multiple is potentially as reliable as estimating the value based on an explicit forecast of distant cash flows\nIn most settings, the EBITDA multiple is more reliable than sales or earnings multiples because it accounts for the firm’s operating efficiency and is not affected by leverage differences between firms\n\n\n\\[\n\\small V^L=\\text{Forecasted EBITDA}\\times\\text{EBITDA Multiple}\n\\]\n\\(\\rightarrow\\) See the accompanying Excel file for the numeric calculations"

It has been introducted by Stern and Stewart Co., a consulting firm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefintion\n\n\nEVA® measures the wealth a company creates (or destroys) each year. It is a company’s after-tax profit from operations minus a charge for the cost of all capital employed to produce those profits – not just the cost of debt, but the cost of equity as well\n\n\n\n\nKey differences when comparing to Net Income:\n\n\nEVA® considers only the operating portion of the firm, disregarding any non-operating results, such as interest income\nIt considers both cost of debt (also included in Net Income) and the cost of equity (not observable, but estimated)"

This loan has a loan origination fee of 1% charged on the principal.\n\nThe amount of the loan origination fee is \\(\\small 1\\% \\times \\$500,000 = \\$5,000\\)\n\nThe actual amount borrowed is \\(\\small \\$500,000-\\$5,000=\\$495,000\\)\n\nInterest rate is charged on the total, and not the discounted value: \\(\\small (\\$500,000 \\times 3\\%=\\$15,000)\\)\nTherefore, the annual effective interest rate is \\(\\small \\$515,000/\\$495,000 - 1 = 4.04\\%\\)"

In that case, the project’s cost of capital can be assessed based on the risk of the firm.\nThe firm’s debt-equity ratio is constant: we consider a firm that adjusts its leverage to maintain a constant debt-equity ratio in terms of market values.\nCorporate taxes are the only imperfection: we assume that the main effect of leverage on valuation is due to the corporate tax shield. Other effects, such as issuance costs, personal costs, and bankruptcy costs, are abstracted away\n\nWhile these assumptions are restrictive, they are also a reasonable approximation for many projects and firms"
