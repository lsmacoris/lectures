    "section": "About the course",
    "text": "About the course\nThis is a hands-on, practical course on Quantitative Finance with applications using R and Python, two of the most widely used open-source software for data analysis. This course aims to attract undergraduate students that are aiming to translate theoretical concepts learned on the core finance courses at FGV-EAESP to practical applications that can guide decision making.\nThe course will be structured in topics that are of interest to Finance practitioners, aiming to include, but not limited to: collecting and organizing financial data, equity valuation, sensitivity analysis and simulation, portfolio optimization, and backtesting. As a final evaluation, students are expected to deliver a capstone data application project showcasing at least one of the topics covered in the course. All applications will be hosted online to enable students to use the capstone project as a showcase of their acquired skills. The course will also host guest presentations from leading industry practitioners and software developers focused on financial applications using open-source languages, where students can interact, ask questions, and get to know more about the possibilities of applying programming, data science, and data analysis skills in the financial industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Getting started\n\n\n\nTo make things easier, ensure to install these packages in your computer and load it at the beginning of every session - I’ll make sure to update this list whenever needed throughout the sessions:\n\n\n\n# Package names\npackages &lt;- c(\"tidyverse\",\"tidyquant\",\"tidymodels\",\"xts\", \"glue\",\"scales\", \"ggthemes\",\"highcharter\")\n\n# Install packages not yet installed\ninstalled_packages &lt;- packages %in% rownames(installed.packages())\n\nif (any(installed_packages == FALSE)) {\n  install.packages(packages[!installed_packages])\n}\n\n# Load all packages\nlapply(packages, library, character.only = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Using Quarto\n\n\n\nIn this course, you’ll be assigned with three data cases, where you’ll need to manipulate code and write your insights altogether. I want to encourage you to give Quarto a try.\nTo install Quarto, follow this link and choose your Operating System. RStudio will automatically locate it and make it as an option whenever creating a new file with Ctrl+N. Why you should give Quarto a try:\n\nIt has multi-language support (Python, R, Julia, JavaScript), parses equations and mathematical notations via pandoc, and integrates seamlessly with GitHub\nAdvanced document formatting and output options: you can choose pdf, html, docx, or even a reveal.js presentation (like the ones from this course!)\nIt is easy, intuitive, and lets you focus on the most important aspect of your work\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Contents\n\n\n\nAt the end of this page, you find the persistent links to all lectures of the course. As they are continuously updated with fixes and new implementations, you might expect some changes from time to time in the contents of each file.\n\nHit F for full-screen mode\nIf you are interest in getting a .pdf version of the slides, hit E to switch to print mode and then Ctrl + P\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Replications\n\n\n\nAlong with the slides, each lecture will also contain a replication file, in .qmd format, containing a thorough discussion for all examples that have been showcased. This file, that will also be posted on eClass®, can be downloaded and replicated on your side.\nTo do that, download the file, open it up in RStudio, and render the Quarto document using the Render button (shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+K).\nYou can find the permanent links to the replication files (.qmd) below:\n\nBridging Finance with Programming - access here\nCollecting, Organizing, and Manipulating Financial Data - access here\nManipulating Time Series Data - access here\nData Visualization - access here"

    "text": "6. Pipe your way through the code %&gt;%\nThe dplyr verbs, in isolation, are a great tool for data analysts, but what really makes them to shine is what glues them together. The pipe operator (%&gt;% or |&gt;) is a key feature of the magrittr package (included in the tidyverse) and is widely used in R, especially together with dplyr, for improving code readability and structuring data transformation workflows. Key benefits include:\n✅ Improved Readability – The sequence of transformations is clear.\n✅ No Need for Temporary Variables – Each step directly passes its result to the next function.\n✅ Avoids Nesting – No deeply nested function calls.\nThe pipe operator allows you to pass the result of one function as the first argument to the next function, making code more readable and eliminating the need for nested function calls. To show its functionality in action, in the code chunk below, both parts of the code produce the exact same result, but the latter, using the pipe operator, is much simpler to read:\n\n#Instead of \nData = read.csv('Data.csv') #Start with the data\nData = mutate(Data, new_var_1=var_1*10)#Mutate\nData = select(Data, var_1,var_2,new_var_1,where(is.numeric))#Select\nData = filter(Data, new_var_1&gt;5)#Filter\nData = arrange(Data, new_var_1,desc(var2))#Arrange\nData = summarize(Data, new_var=mean(new_var_1,na.rm=TRUE))#Summarize\n\n#Do\nData = read.csv('Data.csv')%&gt;% #Start with the data\n        mutate(new_var_1=var_1*10)%&gt;% #Mutate\n        select(var_1,var_2,new_var_1,where(is.numeric))%&gt;% #Select\n        filter(new_var_1&gt;5)%&gt;% #Filter\n        arrange(new_var_1,desc(var2))%&gt;% #Arrange\n        summarize(new_var=mean(new_var_1,na.rm=TRUE))#Summarize"

You can download it using the link shown in Slide 4.\n\nSelect only the symbol, date, and adjusted columns, and arrange the dataset from oldest to newest\nMutate your date variable, making sure to read it as a Date object using as.Date()\nCreate a Year variable and filter only on observations happening in 2025. You can use the year() function to retrieve the year of a given Date column.\nGroup data by symbol\nCreate, for each different symbol, a Return variable that is defined as \\(P_{t+1}/P_{t}\\), where \\(t\\) refers to a date. You can use the lag() function for this\nYou will see that lag produces an NA whenever you try to lag the first observation. To make sure your data does not contain any NA, call drop_na()\nCreate, for each different symbol, a Cum_Return variable that is defined as the cumulative return. Compounded returns over time can be written as \\(\\small \\prod(1+R_t)=(1+R_1)\\times(1+R_2)\\times...\\times(1+R_t)\\). For this, you can use the prod() function.\nPick the latest observation from each symbol and arrange the table from lowest-to-highest return. The function slice_tail(n=x) retrieves the bottom x observations, whereas slice_head(n=y) retrieves the top y."

It calculates the cumulative return for each stock (symbol) in the year 2025, then selects the latest available observation per stock and sorts them from lowest to highest cumulative return.\n\nRead the Data. M7 is assumed to be a data frame or tibble containing stock data ready in your session. You can use read.csv() and store it in an R object. The pipe operator %&gt;%) is used to chain functions together.\nSelect Relevant Columns. Keeps only the relevant columns for the analysis:\n\n\nsymbol → The stock ticker\ndate → The trading date\nadjusted → The adjusted closing price (used for return calculations)\n\nMaking sure the select function is applied as one of the first adjustments can facilitate data wrangling as it shrinks the dataset for the upcoming operations.\n\nEnsure date is a Date object in your session. The code converts the date column to a Date object to enable time-based filtering and calculations, like year().\nFilter Data for 2025. The code uses year(date) == 2025 (from the lubridate package, loaded together with the tidyverse) to keep only data from 2025.\nSort Data in Chronological Order. The code ensures that stock prices are arranged earliest to latest for correct return calculations.\nGroups the dataset by stock (symbol). Using group_by() ensures that return calculations are performed for each stock separately\nCalculate Daily Returns. After the dataset is grouped, we use the mutate() function to create our return metric:\n\n\\[\nReturn=\\dfrac{P_{t}}{P_{t-1}}\n\\]\n\nUses lag(adjusted) to get the previous day’s adjusted price.\nThe first row in each group will have NA (because there’s no previous price)\n\nBecause of that, we also need a call to drop_na() to make sure that whenever we are multiplying these indices, we are not including NA values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe function cumprod(), which calculates the cumulative product of a series, multiplies values sequentially. However, if there are missing values (NA) in the sequence, cumprod() propagates NA to all subsequent values. This can corrupt the entire computation.\nFor example, ommitting the drop_na() step in the solution code would produce NA all over Cum_Return:\n\n#Read the Data\nM7%&gt;%\n#Select only the columns of interest\nselect(symbol,date,adjusted)%&gt;%\n#Make sure date is read as a Date object\nmutate(date=as.Date(date))%&gt;%\n#Filter for observations happening in 2025\nfilter(year(date)==2025)%&gt;%\n#Arrange from chronological order\narrange(date)%&gt;%\n#Group by Symbol to perform the calculations\ngroup_by(symbol)%&gt;%\n#Create the return\nmutate(Return = adjusted/lag(adjusted,default = NA))%&gt;%\n#Remove NAs before doing the cumulative product\nmutate(Cum_Return = cumprod(Return)-1)\n\n# A tibble: 126 × 5\n# Groups:   symbol [7]\n   symbol date       adjusted Return Cum_Return\n   &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;date&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 AAPL   2025-01-02     244.

With the series of daily returns in place cumulative return over time can be retrieved by compounding each individual return over time:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cumulative Return}_{t=1\\rightarrow T}= (1+R_1)\\times(1+R_2)\\times(1+R_3)\\times...\\times(1+R_t)\\equiv\\prod_{t=1}^{T}(1+R_t)\n\\] To perform such calculations, the code uses cumprod(Return), which multiplies returns over time. In the end, we also need to subtract 1 to express it as a percentage return.\n\nSelect the Latest Observation Per Stock. The slice_tail() function keeps only the last row (i.e., the most recent date) for each stock. Note that this behavior is only possible because our data has been grouped by symbol in the subsequent steps. In an ungrouped case, slice_tail() would retrieve the latest observation considering the data as a whole - in this case, META cumulative returns.\nKeep Only Key Columns and Rearrange. After we’re done creating the relevant variables, we can use the select() function to keep only the columns that are of interest: symbol,date, and Cum_Return, and use the arrange() function to sort observations by ascending order of cumulative returns (i.e, lowest-to-highest)."

What could be going on?\nIt is important to recall some of the model’s shortcomings:\n\nMarket Returns are really context-dependent, and the use of NYSE/DOW/Ibovespa etc is problem-specific\nThe sensitivity to market returns, \\(\\small \\beta\\), might not be stable over time\nSystematic Risk might not be the only factor that matters!\nAssumptions of the CAPM might not be that realistic"

Nowadays, financial information is accessible to the broader public almost in real time:\n\nYahoo! Finance provides data on stocks, ETFs, and market indices\nEDGAR provides information on all periodic fillings provided by US-listed companies\nA wide range of social media platforms, such as X (formerly Twitter) and Reddit, have been recently use as a way to spread and collect financial information"

As a partner in KKP Investments, you are investigating purchasing the company\nIf a deal can be reached, the acquisition will take place at the end of the current fiscal year. In that event, KKP plans to implement operational and financial improvements at Ideko over the next five years, after which it intends to sell the business\nYou believe a deal could be struck to purchase Ideko’s equity at the end of this fiscal year for an acquisition price of $150 million, which is almost double Ideko’s current book value of equity.\n\n\nQuestion: is this price reasonable?"

    "text": "Fundos de Investimento em Direito Creditório - FIDCs\n\nA common way to organize resources to finance short-term mismatches is through the use of a FIDC1, which is similar to discount operations and factoring\nHow it works: suppose that a firm sells its products to customers with a 90-days payment, and it needs money today to finance its operations:\n\n\nA FIDC collects money from investors aiming to be exposed to credit operations\nA FIDC then buys several credit obligations, in the same way that a factoring firm does, and bears the risk of the operation\nUltimately, the shareholders of the FIDC are the ones bearing the risk in the event of non-payment by the firm’s clients\n\n\nKey benefit: FIDCs do not need to concentrate risk in only one type of credit operation and/or customer, and can be scaled more easily by through publicly issuances (emissões)\n\nFor detailed information on how FIDCs work, see a detailed description by ANBIMA."

    "text": "Institutional stability and investor protection\n\nWhenever property rights and contract-enforcement are put in risk, lenders adjust interest rates to cope with the expected risk\nFor example, as seizing collateral may involve a lot of bureaucracy, banks adjust the interest rates for some specific credit contracts\n\n\nThat helps to explain, for example, why countries with higher levels of institutional development, such as higher investor protection and stable laws, have lower interest rates\nIt also helps to explain why, even with decreases in the baseline Brazilian interest rate (SELIC), these changes are not fully reflected in the interest rate offered to customers and firms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating (dis)incentives?\n\n\nAn interesting discussion in terms of firms’ incentives to comply with credit terms rely on Credit Renegotiation programs, such as Desenrola. When fully predicted by firms and customers, it can create distortions in terms of incentives, since firms anticipate that they’ll be able to renegotiate at lower rates, thereby creating incentives for strategic defaults."

    "text": "Types of Mergers\n\nFrom an historical perspective, M&A activity was quite different across each wave. What actually characterizes mergers?\nWhile we tend to talk about merger waves and mergers in general, the term “merger,” as commonly used, encompasses several types of transactions that vary by the relation between the target and the acquirer and the method of payment used in the transaction, which are generally included in a document called term-sheet\n\n\nRelationship between target and acquirer:\n\nIf the target and acquirer are in the same industry, the merger is typically called a horizontal merger\nIf the target’s industry buys or sells to the acquirer’s industry, it is called a vertical merger\nFinally, if the target and acquirer operate in unrelated industries, the deal is a conglomerate merger"

Commonly, however, target shareholders receive stock, cash, or a mix of the two"

Therefore, we get a more clear view on how the operating assets of a firm are being put in production\nIn other words, absent any effects coming from financing decisions, how well are the firm’s operating activities?"

In other words, the outcome for the target is the same as an IPO, but without the SEC’s rigorous listing requirements or the long IPO sales process!\n\n\n\\(\\rightarrow\\) Lower requirements are not always desirable: see here the fraudulent case of the electic vehicle startup Nikola involved in a SPAC merger"

You can pass additional layers using the + operator. For changing the labels, you can use the labs(x='Your X Label',y='Your Y Label', title='Your Title', subtitle='Your subtitle') syntax. The x-axis should be called “Date,” y-axis should be called “Adjusted Prices”, the title should be called “META Prices Over Time”, and the subtitle should be called “Source: Yahoo! Finance”. The FANG dataset and ggplot2 have been already loaded for you.

    "section": "1. Introduction to install.packages() and library() in R",
    "text": "1. Introduction to install.packages() and library() in R\nWhen you’re starting with R, you’ll frequently need to install and load packages to access additional functions beyond the base R functionalities. Two essential functions for this are:\n\ninstall.packages() – Downloads and installs a package from CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network).\nlibrary() – Loads an installed package so that you can use its functions\n\nFor installing new packages, the syntax is:\n\ninstall.packages(\"package_name\")\n\nNote that:\n\nYou only need to install a package once (unless you update or reinstall R).\nPackages are stored in a library (a folder on your computer).\nIf a package is not available, check your internet connection or make sure CRAN is accessible.\n\nOnce a package is installed, you need to load it every time you start a new R session. The function library() makes the functions from the referred package available for use. For example, after installing ggplot2 using install.packages(\"ggplot2\"), load it by calling:\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nIf you forget to load a package and try to use its functions, R will throw an error:\n\nError in ggplot(): could not find function \"ggplot\"\n\nIn this course, we will be mostly using a handful of packages for data collection, data wrangling, and visualization. Namely, we will be mostly working with the following packages:\n\ntidyverse: for data manipulation and visualization, including packages such as dplyr,gpplot2, and tidyr\ntidyquant: for retrieving and working with financial data series\ntidymodels: a set of routines for running statistical models\nglue: a simple and efficient way to interpolate strings\nscales: provides functions that are particularly useful for visualization, helping scaling axes, formatting labels, and applying transformations like logarithms or percentages.\nggthemes: a set of powerful themes for data visualization\n\nFor installing these packages, you could simply call:\n\n#Install if not already available\n  install.packages('tidyverse')\n  install.packages('tidyquant')\n  install.packages('glue')\n  install.packages('scales')\n  install.packages('ggthemes')\n\n#Load\n  library(tidyverse)\n  library(tidyquant)\n  library(tidymodels)\n  library(glue)\n  library(scales)\n  library(ggthemes)\n\nAlternatively, the code below searches for a given set of packages in our computer, installing only the packages that are not found. After installing all missing packages (if any) it loads all packages together:\n\n# Package names\npackages &lt;- c(\"tidyverse\",\"tidyquant\",\"tidymodels\", \"glue\",\"scales\")\n\n# Install packages not yet installed\ninstalled_packages &lt;- packages %in% rownames(installed.packages())\n\nif (any(installed_packages == FALSE)) {\n  install.packages(packages[!installed_packages])\n}\n\n# Load all packages\ninvisible(lapply(packages, library, character.only = TRUE))\n\nMake sure to install all packages and load them, either by calling library() individually, or running the aforementioned code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor the remainder of the sessions, you will use financial data from multiple sources, either that being from a local .csv file or a pull from Yahoo! Finance. Whenever you are working with local files, it is always important to make sure that your R is able to locate it. To check the working directory of your session, simply type getwd(), and it will prompt your current directory. If you want to change your directory, simply type setwd('C:/path/to/your/folder') with the specific path to your desired folder. To make sure that you switched directories, you can type getwd() to confirm the new directory.\nMost of the issues regarding not being able to load a specific file, like .csv and .xlsx spreadsheets can be easily solved by placing your R file (either a plain script, like myscript.R, or a quarto document, myquartodoc.qmd) in the same folder as of your data. When you open your R script or Quarto document, it will automatically set that folder (which coincides with the data folder) as the working directory. To confirm which files are available to you, you can simply type list.files() to get the list of all files that R can find in the working directory.\nIf you prefer, whenever you are calling a function that requires a path to your computer, you can always provide the full path of the file: for example, using \"C:/Users/Lucas/Documents/GitHub/Folder/test.csv' would find the test.csv even if Folder is not your working directory."

Due to its timestamp component, one can shift variables backwards (using the lag() function) as well as forward (using the lag()) function:\n\n\nlagged_data &lt;- lag(data1)  # Shift values by 1 day\nprint(lagged_data)\n\n                 [,1]\n2024-01-01         NA\n2024-01-02 -0.3188591\n2024-01-03  1.3669653\n2024-01-04 -0.5614160\n2024-01-05  2.3792035\n\nmerged_data &lt;- merge(lagged_data, data1, join = \"outer\")\nprint(merged_data)\n\n           lagged_data      data1\n2024-01-01          NA -0.3188591\n2024-01-02  -0.3188591  1.3669653\n2024-01-03   1.3669653 -0.5614160\n2024-01-04  -0.5614160  2.3792035\n2024-01-05   2.3792035 -0.7954646\n\n\nAll in all, when it comes to working with financial data, xts objects are particularly useful for:\n\nHandling stock price data from tidyquant\nCalculating log returns for portfolio management\nAligning time series data (e.g., joining different financial datasets)\nAggregating financial data (e.g., monthly returns)\nSubsetting data by years/months/days\nCalculating rolling functions (e.g, yearly averages)\nAggregating data at different intervals (e.g, convert daily to weekly prices)\n\nUnfortunately, there is an issue: the tidyverse is not fully designed to work with time series classes, such as xts. Since xts is optimized for time series operations, some functions that would work well when managing time series are not easily translated using the packages from the tidyverse:\n\ntidyverse: Designed for tabular (data frame-like) structures, emphasizing “tidy” data (each row is an observation, each column is a variable)\nxts: Designed for time series, optimizing time-based indexing and calculations but less compatible with tidyverse workflows"

You can use the tq_transmute() function, passing the yearlyReturn() function along the chain\nFor the Deadlift data set, regroup the data by date and calculate the Deadlift returns using a mutate() function (Hint: it is an equally weighted portfolio)\nMerge both datasets using inner_join()"

Starting with the Deadlift ETF, we first fetch historical stock prices using tq_get() for each asset contained in the ETF. After that, we only keep the relevant columns - namely, symbol, date, and adjusted. Using group_by() to group by symbol, we use the tq_transmute() function to apply the yearlyReturns function to the adjusted column, renaming it as Deadlift.\nCalculating portfolio returns. Since this ETF is an equally-weighted portfolio, and using the fact that a portfolio return is a weighted average of the individual securities, you can safely use the mean() function to calculate the return of such portfolio. To make sure that the calculation is performed for each year, use group_by() again, grouping by date."

It retrieves stock data from Yahoo! Finance, applies ggplot2 for visualization, and customizes the plot using ggthemes.\n\nDefine Date Ranges. These dates specify the period over which GME stock data will be retrieved. More specifically, start and end are used to filter the tq_get() function, whereas reddit_date marks the key event when WallStreetBets (WSB) discussions fueled the GME rally, and will be used in the ggplot call to annotate the exact period where the frenzy happened.\nRetrieve Stock Data. The tq_get() fetches stock price data for GameStop (GME) from Yahoo! Finance. It returns a data frame with the following columns: date, open, high, low, close, adjusted, volume.\nCreate Candlestick Chart. While the ggplot(aes(x = date, group = symbol)) creates a basic ggplot chart, the geom_candlestick(aes(open = open, high = high, low = low, close = close)) maps the specific variables onto the OHLC information.\nAdd Labels. Using the labs() function, it is possible to customize several aspects of the chart, such as the x and y labels, as well as the title and subtitle.\nAnnotate the Reddit Frenzy date. The geom_vline() adds a dashed vertical line at reddit_date (Jan 25, 2021) to highlight the Reddit-driven rally. More specifically, the function places a text label “Reddit Frenzy Starts” near the line, x = reddit_date - 5 shifts text 5 days to the left for better visibility, y = 75 positions it at $75, and angle = 90 rotates the text vertically.\nCustomize Axes. Thescale_x_date(date_breaks = '2 weeks') ensures the x-axis shows date breaks every 2 weeks, while the scale_y_continuous(labels = dollar) formats y-axis values as dollar amounts.\nApply and customize predefined themes. The theme_economist() function applies a professional, clean theme from ggthemes, inspired by The Economist famous financial charts. On top of that, the theme() function edits various aspects of the predefined theme, such as bold titles, font sizes, and more, to better convey the message."
