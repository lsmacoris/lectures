  abstract  = "This book describes the new generation of discrete choice
               methods, focusing on the many advances that are made possible by
               simulation. Researchers use these statistical methods to examine
               the choices that consumers, households, firms, and other agents
               make. Each of the major models is covered: logit, generalized
               extreme value, or GEV (including nested and cross-nested
               logits), probit, and mixed logit, plus a variety of
               specifications that build on these basics. Recent advances in
               Bayesian procedures are explored, including the use of the
               Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and its variant Gibbs sampling.
               This second edition adds chapters on endogeneity and
               expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms. No other book
               incorporates all these fields, which have arisen in the past 25
               years. The procedures are applicable in many fields, including
               energy, transportation, environmental studies, health, labor,
               and marketing.",
