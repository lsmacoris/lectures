## Organizing Financial Data

::: callout-tip
### A note on Tidy Data

*"Tidy datasets are all alike, but every messy dataset is messy in its own way. Tidy datasets provide a standardized way to link the structure of a dataset (its physical layout) with its semantics (its meaning)."*
:::

-   Stock price information is an example of raw data that can be easily pulled from providers such as *Yahoo! Finance*. However, it is not often structured in a tidy and convenient way

    1.  In this lecture, we will be working with daily stock price data from the *Magnificent Seven* (*AMZN*, *GOOG*, *MSFT*, *NVDA*, *TSLA*, *AMZN*, and *META*)
    2.  I have already downloaded the data for you using the `tidyquant` package, which allows us to pull stock price data from multiple securities in a convenient format. You can hit the *Download* button to get a grasp on how the data looks like

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false

M7%>%
  download_this(
    output_name = "M7",
    output_extension = ".csv",
    button_label = "Download",
    has_icon = TRUE,
    icon = "fa fa-save")

```

## The basic `dplyr` verbs: recap

:::::: nonincremental
-   [`dplyr`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) is a grammar of data manipulation, contained in the `tidyverse`, providing a consistent set of verbs that help you solve the most common data manipulation challenges:

::::: columns
::: {.column width="25%" text-align="center"}
![](Images/dplyr.png)
:::

::: {.column width="75%" text-align="center"}
1.  `mutate()` adds new variables that are functions of existing variables
2.  `select()` picks variables based on their names
3.  `filter()` picks cases based on their values
4.  `summarise()` reduces multiple values down to a single summary
5.  `arrange()` changes the ordering of the rows
:::
:::::
::::::

## The `mutate()` function

::: callout-tip
### Definition

The `mutate()` function adds new variables that are functions of existing variables:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

mutate(.data, #The object you are performing the calculations 
       new_variable_1 = var1 * 2, #Can use basic operations...
       new_variable_2 = median(var2), #Or predefined functions)
       variable_3 = as.character(var3) #And can be used to modify existing variables)
       ) 
```
:::

1.  This function takes the `.data` argument you provided (in your example, the `Data` object)...
2.  It sequentially creates the columns you asked for and place them to the right of your `data.frame` (or `tibble`)
3.  You can use any function, predefined or custom, and apply it to `mutate()`
4.  It can also modify any columns you want (if the name is the same as an existing column)

## The `mutate()` function, practice

::::: panel-tabset
## Exercise

::: {#lst-mutate}
```{webr}
#| exercise: mutate
#| completion: true
#| min-lines: 7
#| max-lines: 10
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 4

#Apply function to the data
M7=_____(M7, mid= _____)

#Show the first 10 observations
head(M7)

```

Use columns `high` and `low` and create a new column, `mid`, defined as the average between daily high and low prices. The `M7` dataset has been already loaded for you. Even if you submit the wrong answer, a live-tutoring feature will provide you with a handful of tips to adjust your code and resubmit your solution.
:::

## Solution

::: {.solution exercise="mutate"}
First, use the `mutate()` function to create the `mid` column.

After that, define `mid` as `(high+low)/2` to calculate the average between the two values.

```{webr}
#| exercise: mutate
#| solution: true

#Apply function to the data
M7=mutate(M7, mid= (high+low)/2)

#Show the first 10 observations
head(M7)

```
:::

```{webr}
#| exercise: mutate
#| check: true
gradethis::grade_this_code()
```
:::::

## The `select()` function

::: callout-tip
### Definition

The `select()` function select (and optionally rename) variables in a data frame, using a concise mini-language that makes it easy to refer to variables based on their name (*e.g*. `a:f` selects all columns from `a` on the left to `f` on the right) or type (e.g. `where(is.numeric)` selects all numeric columns)

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

select(.data, #The object which you are performing the operations 
       variable_3, #Can reorder columns
       variable_1, 
       variable_2:variable_4, #Matches position patterns 
       where(is.numeric) #Can select all columns that match a given pattern
       ) 
```
:::

1.  This function takes the `.data` argument you provided (in your example, the `Data` object)...
2.  And select only the columns you've asked for
3.  You can also use `select(.data,-variable)` to remove a variable
4.  It keeps the structure of the `data.frame` intact - no rows are affected

## The `select()` function, continued

-   The `select()` function also comes with a handy companion of `selectors`, which are functions that help you cherry pick columns in a concise way, rather than hardcoding them altogether:

    1.  `:` for selecting a range of consecutive variables.
    2.  `starts_with()` starts with a string
    3.  `ends_with()` ends with a string
    4.  `contains()` contains a string
    5.  `matches()`matches a regular expression.
    6.  `where()`a function to all variables and selects those for which the function returns `TRUE`

## The `select()` function, practice

::::: panel-tabset
## Exercise

::: {#lst-select}
```{webr}
#| exercise: select
#| completion: true
#| min-lines: 7
#| max-lines: 10
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 4

#Apply function to the data
M7=_____(M7,_____)

#Show the first 10 observations
head(M7)

```

Select only the `symbol`, `date`, `volume`, and `adjusted`, in that order. The `M7` dataset has been already loaded for you. Even if you submit the wrong answer, a live-tutoring feature will provide you with a handful of tips to adjust your code and resubmit your solution.
:::

## Solution

::: {.solution exercise="select"}
Use the `select()` function to select only a subset of the available columns:

```{webr}
#| exercise: select
#| solution: true

#Apply function to the data
M7=select(M7,symbol,date,volume,adjusted)

#Show the first 10 observations
head(M7)

```
:::

```{webr}
#| exercise: select
#| check: true

```
:::::

## The `filter()` function

::: callout-tip
### Definition

The `filter()` function is used to subset a data frame, retaining all rows that satisfy your conditions. To be retained, the row must produce a value of `TRUE` for all conditions.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

filter(.data, #The object which you are performing the operations
       variable_1 >10, #Simple arithmetic operators
       variable_2 %in% c('AAPL','MSFT','FORD'), #Pattern search
       !(variable_3 %in% c('Boston','Mass','Silicon Valley')), #Negate pattern search
       variable_4 >=10 & variable_3<= 4 | is.na(variable_4) #IF and OR conditions
       ) 
```
:::

1.  This function takes the `.data` argument you provided (in your example, the `Data` object)...
2.  And filter the rows based on the conditions outlined
3.  You can use any function, predefined or custom, and apply it to `filter()`
4.  It returns a subset of the whole object, keeping the columns and the data structure intact

## The `filter()` function, practice

::::: panel-tabset
## Exercise

::: {#lst-filter}
```{webr}
#| exercise: filter
#| completion: true
#| min-lines: 7
#| max-lines: 10
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 4

#Apply function to the data
M7=_____(M7,_____)

#Show the first 10 observations
head(M7)

```

Filter for observations that occurred in 2025, only. You can use the `year()` function with the `date` variable to retrieve the year. The `M7` dataset has been already loaded for you. Even if you submit the wrong answer, a live-tutoring feature will provide you with a handful of tips to adjust your code and resubmit your solution.
:::

## Solution

::: {.solution exercise="filter"}
Use the `filter()` together with `year(date)`:

```{webr}
#| exercise: filter
#| solution: true

#Apply function to the data
M7=filter(M7,year(date)==2025)

#Show the first 10 observations
head(M7)

```
:::

```{webr}
#| exercise: filter
#| check: true
gradethis::grade_this_code()
```
:::::

## The `arrange()` function

::: callout-tip
### Definition

The `arrange()` function reorders the rows of a data frame by the values of selected columns:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

#Some Options, always in the following format: the object you are rearranging + the reordering scheme
arrange(.data, variable1) #Ascending by variable_1
arrange(.data, variable1, variable_2) #Ascending by variable_1 and then variable_2
arrange(.data, variable2, variable_1) #Ascending by variable_2 and then variable 1
arrange(.data, variable1, desc(variable_2)) #Ascending by variable_1, and then descending by variable_2
```
:::

1.  This function takes the `.data` argument you provided (in your example, the `Data` object)...
2.  And reorders the rows of your `data.frame` (or `tibble`)
3.  This can be useful for visualization, but also for applying position-dependent functions, like `lag()`, `lead()`, `head()`, and `tail()`

## The `arrange()` function, practice

::::: panel-tabset
## Exercise

::: {#lst-arrange}
```{webr}
#| exercise: arrange
#| completion: true
#| min-lines: 7
#| max-lines: 10
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 4

#Apply function to the data
M7=arrange(M7,_____)

#Show the first 10 observations
head(M7)

```

Arrange the dataset by descending `date` (newest to oldest) and `symbol`. The `M7` dataset has been already loaded for you. Even if you submit the wrong answer, a live-tutoring feature will provide you with a handful of tips to adjust your code and resubmit your solution.
:::

## Solution

::: {.solution exercise="arrange"}
Use the `arrange()` together with `desc(date)` and `symbol`:

```{webr}
#| exercise: arrange
#| solution: true

#Apply function to the data
M7=arrange(M7,desc(date),symbol)

#Show the first 10 observations
head(M7)

```
:::

```{webr}
#| exercise: arrange
#| check: true
gradethis::grade_this_code()
```
:::::

## The `summarize()` function

::: callout-tip
### Definition

The `summarise()` - or `summarize()` - function creates a new data frame. It returns one row for each combination of grouping variables; if there are no grouping variables, the output will have a single row summarising all observations in the input. It will contain one column for each grouping variable and one column for each of the summary statistics that you have specified.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

summarize(.data, #The object which you are performing the operations 
       new_variable_1 = mean(var1,na.rm=TRUE), #Average of var1, removing NA values
       new_variable_2 = median(var2,na.rm=TRUE), #Median of var1, removing, NA values
       new_variable_3 = n_distinct(var2) #Number of unique values of var2
       ) 
```
:::

1.  This function takes the `.data` argument you provided (in your example, the `Data` object)...
2.  And reshapes the `data.frame` (or `tibble`) by the aggregation functions
3.  As the name suggests, it is used to summarize a table

## The `summarize()` function, practice

::::: panel-tabset
## Exercise

::: {#lst-summarize}
```{webr}
#| exercise: summarize
#| completion: true
#| min-lines: 7
#| max-lines: 10
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 4

#Apply function to the data
Summary=summarize(M7,_____)

#Show the first 10 observations
head(M7)

```

Summarize the dataset by creating an `average` column, defined as the average `adjusted` prices. You can use the `mean()` function to get the average. Use the option `na.rm=TRUE` inside the `mean` function to make sure that `NA` values are disregarded. The `M7` dataset has been already loaded for you. Even if you submit the wrong answer, a live-tutoring feature will provide you with a handful of tips to adjust your code and resubmit your solution.
:::

## Solution

::: {.solution exercise="summarize"}
Use the `summarize()` together with `mean()`:

```{webr}
#| exercise: summarize
#| solution: true

#Apply function to the data
Summary=summarize(M7,average=mean(adjusted,na.rm=TRUE))

#Show the first observations
head(Summary)

```
:::

```{webr}
#| exercise: summarize
#| check: true
gradethis::grade_this_code()
```
:::::

## Slice and dice through `group_by()`

-   You saw how the `tidyverse` verbs helps us getting ahead of the game when it comes to data operations. In most cases, however, you may need to add an extra layer of complexity: perform operations *groupwise*:

    1.  Get the average returns by each stock
    2.  Filter for the 10 highest prices for each year
    3.  Calculate the median return for each industry

-   For cases like this, we need to find a convenient way of repeating the same operation across subsets of our data

-   It goes without saying that there should be a function in the `tidyverse` that makes this operation straightforward: fortunately, you can use `group_by()` together with all previous `dplyr` verbs!

## Slice and dice through `group_by()`, continued

::: callout-tip
### Definition

The `group_by()` function takes an existing table and converts it into a *grouped* table where operations are performed "by group". Using `ungroup()` removes grouping.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

Data=group_by(Data,v1,v2,v3)
Data=summarize(avg=mean(x,na.rm=TRUE))

```
:::

1.  This function takes the `.data` argument you provided (in your example, the `Data` object)...
2.  And creates the `avg` variable taking the average of `x` within each tuple defined by the grouping variables (in this case, `v1`,`v2`, and `v3` )
3.  It returns a `grouped dataframe`, with the results of `avg` displayed for each unique combination of `v1`,`v2`, and `v3`

## Revisiting average prices

-   Let's try the latest `summarize()` call again, but now grouping the data by `symbol` first

```{webr}

#Apply function to the data
M7=group_by(M7,symbol)
Summary=summarize(M7,average=mean(adjusted,na.rm=TRUE))

#Show the first 10 observations
head(Summary,10)

```

## Combining multiple operations

-   In the previous exercises, you have used the main `dplyr` verbs to create, select, arrange, filter, and summarize data, one by one. In practical applications, however it is likely that you need more than one of these functionalities at the same time

-   It is tempting to do it piecewise:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

#Start with the data
Data = read.csv('Data.csv')
#Mutate
Data = mutate(Data, new_var_1=var_1*10)
#Select
Data = select(Data, var_1,var_2,new_var_1,where(is.numeric))
#Filter
Data = filter(Data, new_var_1>5)
#Arrange
Data = arrange(Data, new_var_1,desc(var2))
#Summarize
Data = summarize(Data, new_var=mean(new_var_1,na.rm=TRUE))
```

-   Although organized, it is wildly *inefficient*: you are sequentially (re)creating the same object all over again - not to mention that you called `Data` $10$ times!

## Pipe your way through the code `%>%`

-   The `dplyr` verbs, in isolation, are a great tool for data analysts, but what really makes them to shine is what glues them together: I introduce you the pipe (`%>%` or `|>`)

![](Images/F1.png){fig-align="center"}

## Pipe your way through the code `%>%`, continued

-   [René Magritte](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Magritte) was right when he claimed that, in *The Treachery of Images* *(La Trahison des images)*, there was not a pipe

-   In fact, the pipe that is relevant for us, `R` users, was only introduced recently, in the `magrittr` package, which makes clear allusion to the artist

-   The `pipe` operator (`%>%` or `|>`) helps you chain operations sequentially, in such a way that the [output]{.blue} of one operation serves as the [input]{.blue} of the subsequent one!

    1.  Instead of repeating the `.data` input multiple times, you [chain]{.blue} the operations using the pipe operator
    2.  It tremendously improve code readability and minimizes spelling errors (now you only need to type in the `.data` argument once!)
    3.  Finally, it makes your code much more efficient: you don't need to allocate memory to (re)create the same object in each step

## Pipe your way through the code `%>%`, continued

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

#Instead of 
Data = read.csv('Data.csv') #Start with the data
Data = mutate(Data, new_var_1=var_1*10)#Mutate
Data = select(Data, var_1,var_2,new_var_1,where(is.numeric))#Select
Data = filter(Data, new_var_1>5)#Filter
Data = arrange(Data, new_var_1,desc(var2))#Arrange
Data = summarize(Data, new_var=mean(new_var_1,na.rm=TRUE))#Summarize

#Do
Data = read.csv('Data.csv')%>% #Start with the data
        mutate(new_var_1=var_1*10)%>% #Mutate
        select(var_1,var_2,new_var_1,where(is.numeric))%>% #Select
        filter(new_var_1>5)%>% #Filter
        arrange(new_var_1,desc(var2))%>% #Arrange
        summarize(new_var=mean(new_var_1,na.rm=TRUE))#Summarize

```

-   The `pipe` operator lets you pass the object on its *left-hand* side to the first argument of the function on the *right-hand* side

-   Another nice feature in `R` is [lazy evaluation](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/functions.html#lazy-evaluation): function arguments are only evaluated [if (and when)]{.blue} they are accessed. This allows us to refer to variables that will only be created *within* the `pipe` without breaking the code!

## Practical Exercise

-   On January $25^{th}$, chinese startup *DeepSeek* disrupted the tech stock market as investors reassessed the likely future investment in Artificial Intelligence hardware

![](Images/F2.png){fig-align="center" width="25%"}

$\rightarrow$ [Read: *Tech stocks slump as China’s DeepSeek stokes fears over AI spending (Financial Times)*](https://www.ft.com/content/e670a4ea-05ad-4419-b72a-7727e8a6d471)

## Hands-On Exercise

-   As part of your work as a buy-side analyst, you were asked to analyze how the *Magnificent 7* performed after the *DeepSeek*

-   Follow the instructions and answer to the following question: **which stock suffered the most during January 2025?**

1.  To answer this question, you will be using all `dplyr` verbs you've practiced so far
2.  Furthermore, you will be also using some common base R and ther `dplyr` functions, like `lag()`, `prod()`, `as.Date()` and `drop_na()`

-   The expected result is a `data.frame` object that shows, for each `symbol`, the monthly return on January, 2025, ordered from lowest-to-highest

$\rightarrow$ *Suggested solution will be provided in the replication file for this lecture.*

## Hands-On Exercise, continued

::: callout-tip
### Instructions

The data, stored in `M7.csv`, can be loaded using `read.csv('M7.csv')`. You can download it using the link shown in *Slide 4*.

1.  Select only the `symbol`, `date`, and `adjusted` columns, and arrange the dataset from oldest to newest
2.  Mutate your `date` variable, making sure to read it as a Date object using `as.Date()`
3.  Create a `Year` variable and filter only on observations happening in 2025. You can use the `year()` function to retrieve the year of a given `Date` column.
4.  Group data by `symbol`
5.  Create, for each different `symbol`, a `Return` variable that is defined as $P_{t+1}/P_{t}$, where $t$ refers to a date. You can use the `lag()` function for this
6.  You will see that `lag` produces an `NA` whenever you try to lag the first observation. To make sure your data does not contain any `NA`, call `drop_na()`
7.  Create, for each different `symbol`, a `Cum_Return` variable that is defined as the cumulative return. Compounded returns over time can be written as $\small \prod(1+R_t)=(1+R_1)\times(1+R_2)\times...\times(1+R_t)$. For this, you can use the `prod()` function.
8.  Pick the latest observation from each `symbol` and arrange the table from lowest-to-highest return. The function `slice_tail(n=x)` retrieves the bottom `x` observations, whereas `slice_head(n=y)` retrieves the top `y`.

## Helpful tips while using R and Quarto

-   As you pave your way through the coding exercises, there are a couple of best practices that will make your life easier when dealing with data in an `R` session:

    1.  Whenever you are loading data, make sure to refer to the correct path where the file is located. You can use the function `getwd()` without any arguments to retrieve the current path, and `setwd('C:/Users/you/newpath/')` to set up a new working directory

    2.  The easiest way to make this logic redundant is to place the `.R` (or `.qmd`) script in the same folder as the data file (in our case, `M7.csv`). When you open the script, it will point to its own directory as the working directory - which will coincide with the data directory

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true


getwd() #Gets the current directory. For Windows users, this is generally defaulted to C:/Users/USER/Documents
setwd('C:/Users/Lucas/Desktop') #changing this to desktop
list.files() #You can confirm if your data is listed in this directory
read.csv('M7.csv') #It works without entering the full path since M7 is in the current path

```

## Helpful tips while using R and Quarto, continued

1.  *RStudio* allows you to interact with your session piece wise - this means that you don't need to run your code chunks all at once
    -   To run only a specific portion of your code, select the specific code lines you want to run and hit `Ctrl + Enter`
    -   As an effect, `R` will run only the selected lines directly into your session, and the output from these lines will be prompted into your session
2.  If you are working on a *Quarto* notebook, you can use the same strategy to run specific lines directly into your session, or you can hit `Ctrl+Shift+K` to render the output altogether

-   Try this copy-pasting the code from the next slide in your R Session - we'll dive into the details later on, but note how the output printed in your session changes as you increase the selected lines
