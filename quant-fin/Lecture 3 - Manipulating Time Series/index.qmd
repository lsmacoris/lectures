## Organizing Financial Data

-   In the previous lecture, you worked your way through the exercises by using the amazing `dplyr` functionalities on `data.frames`

-   In this lecture, you will be introduced to a particular type of class in `R`: `xts`

. . .

::: callout-tip
### Definition

`xts` is an `R` package that provides an extension of the `zoo` class, a class with methods for totally ordered indexed observations - in special, [time series]{.blue}

-   With `xts`, you get a lot of flexibility in handling time series observations that are of interest of financial analysts, such as:

    1.  Subsetting data by years/months/days
    2.  Calculating rolling functions (*e.g*, yearly averages)
    3.  Aggregating data at different intervals (*e.g*, convert daily to weekly prices)
:::

. . .

**Question:** but wait, why are we departing from `dplyr`?

## Bridging the `tidyverse` with time series

-   Unfortunately, there is an issue: the `tidyverse` is not fully designed to work with time series classes, such as `xts` and `zoo`

-   As a consequence, you won't be able to use a lot of interesting functionalities that would perfectly apply for time series

    1.  But don't you worry, I got you covered: the `tidyquant` package[^1] integrates the best resources for collecting and analyzing financial data

    2.  It integrates several financial packages, like `zoo`, `xts`, `quantmod`, `TTR`, and `PerformanceAnalytics`, with the tidy data infrastructure of the tidyverse allowing for seamless interaction between each

-   You can now perform complete financial analyses using the same functionalities you've learned so far!

## The `tidyquant` package, a short-video

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/woxJZTL2hok width="800" height="600" >}}

## The `tq_mutate()` function

::: callout-tip
### Definition

The `tq_mutate()` function adds adds new variables to an existing `tibble`;

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

tq_mutate(.data, #The object you are performing the calculations 
       selected_variables, #The columns to send to the mutation function
       mutate_fun, #The mutation function from either the xts, quantmod, or TTR package.
       col_rename #A string or character vector containing names that can be used to quickly rename columns
       ) 
```
:::

1.  The main advantage is the results are returned as a `tibble` and the function can be used with the `tidyverse`
2.  It is used when you expected additional columns to be added to the resulting data frame
3.  You can use several time series related functions from other `R` packages - call `tq_mutate_fun_options()` to see the list of available options
4.  All in all, it is similar in spirit to `mutate()`

## The `tq_transmute()` function

::: callout-tip
### Definition

The `tq_transmute()` returns only newly created columns and is typically used when periodicity changes.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

tq_mutate(.data, #The object you are performing the calculations 
       selected_variables, #The columns to send to the mutation function
       mutate_fun, #The mutation function from either the xts, quantmod, or TTR package.
       col_rename #A string or character vector containing names that can be used to quickly rename columns
       )
```
:::

1.  `tq_transmute()` works exactly like `tq_mutate()` except it only returns the newly created columns
2.  This is helpful when changing periodicity where the new columns would not have the same number of rows as the original tibble
3.  All in all, it is similar in spirit to `summarize()`

## Working with time series objects, Exercise I

-   An immediate useful example of using a time series specific functionality with a tidyverse logic relates to [filtering]{.blue}:
    1.  Sometimes, we may be interested in getting only a subset of the data (for example, only *GOOG* information)
    2.  Furthermore, we may be interested in subsetting only a specific time frame for our analysis
-   It is relatively straightforward to do it with `tidyquant`:
    1.  Use `filter()` to select only rows where `symbol=='GOOG'`
    2.  In the same call, filter for `date`\>= `min_date` and `date`\<=`max_date`

## Working with time series objects, Exercise I

::: panel-tabset
### Code

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

library(tidyquant)
library(tidyverse)

#Set up the list of assets
assets=c('AMZN','GOOG','META','GME')

#Filter out
assets%>%
  tq_get()%>%
  filter(symbol=='GOOG',
         date>='2020-01-01',
         date<='2024-12-31')

```

### Output

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true

library(tidyquant)
library(tidyverse)

#Set up the list of assets
assets=c('AMZN','GOOG','META','GME')

#Filter out
assets%>%
  tq_get()%>%
  filter(symbol=='GOOG',
         date>='2020-01-01',
         date<='2024-12-31')
```

## Working with time series objects, Exercise II

-   Another example of using a time series specific functionality is working with leads and lags:
    1.  Sometimes, we need to shift our variables by a specific interval, like getting the previous day's price
    2.  Say, for example, that you want to understand how *S&P* returns levels relate to *NFLX* returns one-week ahead
-   It is relatively straightforward to do it with `tidyquant`:
    1.  Download *S&P500* and *NFLX* data using the `tq_get()` function
    2.  Use `tq_transmute()` to compute the weekly returns for each security based on daily data
    3.  Use `tq_mutate()` to generate a lagged series of *S&P500* returns

## Working with time series objects, Exercise II

::: panel-tabset
### Code

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

library(tidyquant)
library(tidyverse)

#Netflix Data
NFLX=tq_get('NFLX')%>%
  #Select only the necessary columns
  select(date,symbol,adjusted)%>%
  #Apply the weeklyReturn function and call the new column 'NFLX'
  tq_transmute(mutate_fun = weeklyReturn,
               col_rename = 'NFLX')

#S&P Data
SP500=tq_get('^GSPC')%>%
  #Select only the necessary columns
  select(date,symbol,adjusted)%>%
  #Apply the weeklyReturn function and call the new column 'SP500'
  tq_transmute(mutate_fun = weeklyReturn,
               col_rename = 'SP500')%>%
  #Apply the lag function for n=1 week and call the new column 'SP500'
  tq_transmute(mutate_fun = lag.xts,
            n=1,
            col_rename = 'SP500')%>%
  #Drop all rows with NA information (row 1, in this case)
  drop_na()

#Merge Data 
inner_join(NFLX,SP500)
```

### Output

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true

library(tidyquant)
library(tidyverse)

#Netflix Data
NFLX=tq_get('NFLX')%>%
  #Select only the necessary columns
  select(date,symbol,adjusted)%>%
  #Apply the weeklyReturn function and call the new column 'NFLX'
  tq_transmute(mutate_fun = weeklyReturn,
               col_rename = 'NFLX')

#S&P Data
SP500=tq_get('^GSPC')%>%
  #Select only the necessary columns
  select(date,symbol,adjusted)%>%
  #Apply the weeklyReturn function and call the new column 'SP500'
  tq_transmute(mutate_fun = weeklyReturn,
               col_rename = 'SP500')%>%
  #Apply the lag function for n=1 week and call the new column 'SP500'
  tq_transmute(mutate_fun = lag.xts,
            n=1,
            col_rename = 'SP500')%>%
  #Drop all rows with NA information (row 1, in this case)
  drop_na()

#Merge Data 
inner_join(NFLX,SP500)
```

## Working with time series objects, Exercise III

-   Lastly, finance practitioners are often asked to perform analysis on a rolling basis:
    1.  We may want to calculate a given signal on day $t$ based on past $x$ periods of information
    2.  Say, for example, that you want to calculate a simple and exponential moving average of adjusted prices from 5 days back for a given set of stocks
-   It is relatively straightforward to do it with `tidyquant`:
    1.  Download stock data using the `tq_get()` function
    2.  Use `tq_mutate()` twice along with the `SMA()` and `EMA()` functions setting `n=5`

## Working with time series objects, Exercise III

::: panel-tabset
### Code

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

library(tidyquant)
library(tidyverse)

#Set up the list of assets
assets=c('AMZN','GOOG','META','GME')

assets%>%
  tq_get()%>%
  select(date,symbol,adjusted)%>%
  group_by(symbol)%>%
  tq_mutate(adjusted, mutate_fun = SMA, n = 5)%>%
  tq_mutate(adjusted, mutate_fun = EMA, n = 5)

```

### Output

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true

library(tidyquant)
library(tidyverse)

#Set up the list of assets
assets=c('AMZN','GOOG','META','GME')

assets%>%
  tq_get()%>%
  select(date,symbol,adjusted)%>%
  group_by(symbol)%>%
  tq_mutate(adjusted, mutate_fun = SMA, n = 5)%>%
  tq_mutate(adjusted, mutate_fun = EMA, n = 5)
```

## Wrapping-up on `tidyquant`

-   There is so much you can use from `tidyquant` in your journey as a quantitative financial analyst:

    1.  I'd recommend looking at all the predefined functions supported by `tidyquant` - click [here](https://business-science.github.io/tidyquant/articles/TQ02-quant-integrations-in-tidyquant.html) for a detailed discussion around all supported functions

    2.  You can also customize your *own* functions that work with time series (for example, your secret trading indicator) and pass it over through `tq_mutate()` or `tq_transmute()`

-   In the [official website](https://business-science.github.io/tidyquant/articles/TQ00-introduction-to-tidyquant.html) website, you can find a variety of examples to nurture your creativity around what you can do using this package

-   All in all, that's the motto: time series analysis made easy with `tidyquant` and the `tidyverse`

## Hands-On Exercise

-   Your manager (who did not lift any weights past the last 5 years) wanted to replicate the returns of the so called *Deadlift ETF*. You job is to create a simple table of yearly returns comparing the *Deadlift ETF* *vis-a-vis* the *S&P500* Index. For that, proceed with the following instructions:

::: callout-tip
### Exercise

1.  Use `tq_get()` to load information from the *S&P Index* and the *Deadlift ETF* constituents in two separate `data.frames`
2.  Filter for observations starting in 2020
3.  Create, for each different `symbol`, a `yearly_ret` variable that calculates the yearly return of a given stock
4.  Calculate the *Deadlift* returns (*Hint: it is an equally weighted portfolio*)
5.  Merge both datasets using `inner_join()`
:::

-   When looking at the yearly results from both the *Deadlift ETF* and *S&P500*, which one did perform better? What are the potential explanations for that?
