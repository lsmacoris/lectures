## **About the course**

This is a hands-on, practical course on Quantitative Finance with applications using `R` and `Python`, two of the most widely used open-source software for data analysis. This course aims to attract undergraduate students that are aiming to translate theoretical concepts learned on the core finance courses at *FGV-EAESP* to practical applications that can guide decision making.

The course will be structured in topics that are of interest to Finance practitioners, aiming to include, but not limited to: collecting and organizing financial data, equity valuation, sensitivity analysis and simulation, portfolio optimization, and backtesting. As a final evaluation, students are expected to deliver a capstone data application project showcasing at least one of the topics covered in the course. All applications will be hosted online to enable students to use the capstone project as a showcase of their acquired skills. The course will also host guest presentations from leading industry practitioners and software developers focused on financial applications using open-source languages, where students can interact, ask questions, and get to know more about the possibilities of applying programming, data science, and data analysis skills in the financial industry.

### 1. Getting started

To make things easier, ensure to install these packages in your computer and load it at the beginning of every session - I'll make sure to update this list whenever needed throughout the sessions:

:::

```{r, eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
# Package names
packages <- c("tidyverse","tidyquant","tidymodels","xts", "glue","scales", "ggthemes","highcharter")

# Install packages not yet installed
installed_packages <- packages %in% rownames(installed.packages())

if (any(installed_packages == FALSE)) {
  install.packages(packages[!installed_packages])
}

# Load all packages
lapply(packages, library, character.only = TRUE)

```

### 2. Using Quarto

In this course, you'll be assigned with three data cases, where you'll need to manipulate code and write your insights altogether. I want to encourage you to give [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) a try.

To install [Quarto]{.blue}, follow [this](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) link and choose your Operating System. *RStudio* will automatically locate it and make it as an option whenever creating a new file with `Ctrl+N`. Why you should give Quarto a try:

  1. It has multi-language support (*Python*, *R*, *Julia*, *JavaScript*), parses equations and mathematical notations via *pandoc*, and integrates seamlessly with GitHub
  2. Advanced document formatting and output options: you can choose *pdf*, *html*, *docx*, or even a *reveal.js* presentation (like the ones from this course!)
  3. It is easy, intuitive, and lets you focus on the most important aspect of your work

### 3. Replications

Along with the slides, each lecture will also contain a replication file, in `.qmd` format, containing a thorough discussion for all examples that have been showcased. This file, that will also be posted on *eClassÂ®*, can be downloaded and replicated on your side.

To do that, download the file, open it up in RStudio, and render the Quarto document using the Render button (shortcut: `Ctrl+Shift+K`).

You can find the permanent links to the replication files (`.qmd`) below:
