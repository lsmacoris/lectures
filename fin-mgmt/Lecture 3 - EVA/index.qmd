## Outline

-   The contents herein are not directly discussed in any of the three main textbooks presented in the syllabus

-   In this sense, this lecture will extensively use the following materials:

1.  [206016 - Understanding Economic Value Added]{.blue}
2.  [XLS504 - Understanding Economic Value Added]{.blue} - supplementary *.xlsx* spreadsheet

. . .

$\rightarrow$ Both contents are available on eClass®.

## Dissecting Performance

Let's get back to the example that we've worked on in the [Financial Analysis]{.blue} lecture:

![](Figures/F1.jpg)

-   Are the managers doing a good or a bad job?

## Dissecting Performance, pt. 2

We saw that we can calculate a series of performance indicators that decompose *Net Income*:

1.  [Gross Profit Margin]{.blue} looks at the firm's income after paying out directly-attributable costs;

2.  [Operating Margin]{.blue} shows the firm's income after deducting all operating costs (+SG&A, Depreciation, etc);

3.  [NOPAT]{.blue} deducts taxes from operational performance and insulates the analysis from the effects of debt policy;

4.  [Net Income]{.blue} takes everything into consideration and provides a measure of the income generated that is attributable to the shareholders of the firm.

-   What are we missing here?

## Accounting *vs* Economic Performance

-   Let's make the [Net Income]{.blue} as the starting point. If our goal is to analyze a firm's operational performance, such metric contains a series of drawbacks:

1.  It considers both [Operating]{.blue} and [non-Operating]{.blue} performance altogether
2.  It includes both recurrent and non-recurrent results
3.  It is highly influenced by non-cash items, such as depreciation and amortization
4.  Accounting tax expenses may be highly influenced by external factors, such as tax compensations, tax shields, subventions etc

. . .

**More importantly, we're lacking a key component:**

-   [Net Income]{.blue} only considers the cost of external capital, but it does **not** deduct the implied cost of the shareholders capital -- *i.e*, [Cost of Equity]{.blue}!

## Why this last drawback is so important?

-   Consider two firms that generate \$ 500MM in [Net Income]{.blue} and have the same level of Assets. These firms are comparable across all dimensions, except that these firms are from totally distinct industries:

    1.  The first company operates in a well-established business environment, a highly-predictable industry with a long track record
    2.  The second company operates in a new market and a very dynamic business environment, with a lot of entry/exit of competitors

-   Should shareholders be *indifferent* between investing in these two firms? No! as investors will demand a different compensation for each firm!

-   The problem is that [Net Income]{.blue} (or any derived metric) does not take this into consideration...

-   Therefore, a firm can generate profits to the shareholders and, at the same time, destroy value if the compensation is not enough to offset the risk!

## Introducing EVA®

-   Is the firm [generating value]{.blue} to the shareholders?
-   The first model that we'll use to answer such questions is known as the [Economic Value Added]{.blue} (also known as [EVA®]{.blue})
-   It has been introducted by [Stern and Stewart Co.](https://sternvaluemanagement.com/), a consulting firm

. . .

*Economic Value Added (EVA®) measures the wealth a company creates (or destroys) each year. It is a company's after-tax profit from operations minus a charge for the cost of all capital employed to produce those profits -- not just the cost of debt, but the cost of equity as well*

-   Key differences when comparing to Net Income:

1.  EVA® considers only the [operating]{.blue} portion of the firm, disregarding any non-operating results, such as interest income
2.  It considers *both* cost of debt (also included in Net Income) and the cost of equity (not observable, but estimated)

## A concise explanation of how EVA® works:

(+) Sales Revenues

(-) Operating Costs (Direct and Indirect)

**(=) Operating Profit**

(-) Taxes on Operating Profit

**(=) Net Operating Profit After Taxes**

(-) Estimated Weighted Average Cost of Capital $\times$ Capital Invested by Debt and Equity

[**(=) EVA®**]{.blue}

-   If [EVA®\>0]{.green} $\rightarrow$ firm is creating value to the shareholders
-   If [EVA®\>0]{.red} $\rightarrow$ firm is destroying value to the shaholders
-   If [EVA®=0]{.yellow} $\rightarrow$ shareholders are earning exactly what they should earn to compensate the risk

## EVA® and Firm Value

-   EVA® is not observable, but rather estimated:

    1.  We need to isolate the [Operating Portion]{.blue} from the firms' balance sheet to determine the Operating Capital invested
    2.  We also need an estimate for the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WAcC)

-   Notwithstanding, it expected that:

    1.  The higher the EVA® $\rightarrow$ higher expectations about the firms' prospects $\rightarrow$ higher expected value $\rightarrow$ higher stock price

    2.  However, expectations about the firms' future results constantly change. Because of that, it is difficult to observe a direct relationship between EVA® and firm value

-   In the long-run, empirical studies show that, as expected, this relationship is [positive]{.green}

## How to Calculate EVA®

-   We'll need to depart from purely using financial statements at this point

1.  First, we need to determine that is the [Operating Capital]{.blue}
    -   This is **not** the same as of the firm's Assets
    -   It focuses on the portion that the firm needs to run its operations, and discards items that are not part of that (i.e, short-term investments, financial investments etc)
2.  After that, we need to estimate:
    -   Tax-Rate - the effective tax-rate of the income statement can be misleading
    -   *NOPAT* - this can be estimated as Operating Income $\times$ (1- the estimated Tax-Rate)
    -   WACC - the weighted average cost of capital

. . .

$$
\text{EVA}= \text{NOPAT} -\text{Operating Capital}\times \text{WACC}
$$

## Concept Check

*Pizza Hut Ltd.* has existing assets worth \$500,000, of which it has operating capital invested of \$150,000. The firm's last reported Net Income was \$15,000, and the *Earnings Before Interest and Taxes* (EBIT) was \$50,000. Assuming a 40% tax-rate and a 15% cost of capital, calculate and interpret the firm's Economic Value Added for the period.

. . .

$$
\small
EVA= NOPAT- (WACC\times \text{Operating Capital})\rightarrow 50,000\times(1-40\%)-0.15\times 150,000
$$

-   Therefore, EVA is simply:

. . .

$$
EVA=30,000-22,500=7,500
$$

-   The firm has generated \$7,500 of economic value for the period. This number, as opposed to the net income, takes into account the economic costs of all parties involved in financing the firm's operations -- i.e, creditors and shareholders.

## A new way to look at the balance-sheet

-   Let's think about a concrete case:

. . .

![](Figures/F2.jpg)

-   In general, we distinguish both side of the balance-sheet in terms of [liquidity]{.blue}:
    1.  Current Assets (Liabilities) are earned (due) at a short-period of time
    2.  Long-Term Assets (Liabilities) are earned(due) at longer periods

## Looking at the balance sheet in terms of liquidity

. . .

![](Figures/F3.jpg)

-   In general, we distinguish both side of the balance-sheet in terms of [liquidity]{.blue}:
    1.  Current Assets (Liabilities) are earned (due) at a short-period of tiume
    2.  Long-Term Assets (Liabilities) are earned(due) at longer periods

## Looking at the balance sheet in terms of operating *vs.* financing

. . .

![](Figures/F4.jpg)

-   We can also distinguish accounts in terms of their [destination]{.blue}:
    1.  Operating Assets (Liabilities) are highlighted in darker colors
    2.  Financial Assets (Liabilities) are highlighted in lighter colors

## Two ways of estimating Operating Capital

-   There are [two ways]{.blue} to estimate the Operating Capital that will make part of our calculations:

1.  The first way is to address what is the amount of [Operating Assets]{.blue} that a firm needs to have in place in order to run its operations

    -   It takes into account long-term operating assets, such as PPE and Machinery...
    -   But also takes into account all operating assets needed for the business (e.g, Inventories, Accounts Receivable, Cash)
    -   Formally, we can define it by:

. . .

$$
\small \text{Operating Capital}=\text{Long-Term Operating Capital + Net Working Capital Needs}
$$

-   We'll study Working Capital shortly, but for now, think about all the money that we need to do pay current bills, buy inventories, and produce until we receive from our clients

## Operating Capital, the Assets-side way

1.  Start with the Long-Term portion of Operating Assets:

. . .

(+) PPE: \$60,000\
(+) Other Operating Assets: \$6,000\
**(=) Total**: \$66,000

2.  Now, estimate the *net working capital* needed to run the business:

. . .

(+) Cash: \$12,000\
(+) Inventories: \$12,000\
(+) Account Receivable: \$24,000\
(-) Accounts Payable: \$15,000\
**(=) Total** :\$33,000

3.  Total Operating Capital: \$66,000 + \$33,000 = [\$99,000]{.blue}

## Operating Capital, the Liabilities-side way

-   Another way to calculate the Operating Capital is to look at the sources of Capital:

. . .

$$
\small \text{Operating Capital}=\text{Interest-bearing Liabilities + Equity}
$$

1.  Interest-bearing Liabilities are, in general, all Liabilities that have interest expenses
2.  Equity is the totality of the book-value of Equity

. . .

(+) Short-Term Loans: \$19,000\
(+) Long-Term Loans: \$48,000\
(-) Short-Term Investments: \$8,000\
(+) Shareholder's Equity: \$40,000\
**(=) Total**: \$99,000

3.  Total Operating Capital: \$19,000 + \$48,000 - \$8,000 + \$40,000 = [\$99,000]{.blue}

## Step 2: Calculating NOPAT

-   We can use the Income Statement to calculate the [Net Operating Profit After Taxes]{.blue}

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
![](Figures/F5.jpg)
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
1.  **Method 1**: Operating Profit $\times$ (1- Tax Rate)

    -   Operating Profit: \$12,000\
    -   Tax-Rate: 34%\
    -   NOPAT= \$12,000 $\times$ (1-34%) = \$7,920

2.  **Method 2:** Add back Interest Expenses (net of tax)

    -   Net Income: \$5,069
    -   Interest Expenses: \$4,320
    -   Tax Rate: 34%
    -   NOPAT= \$5,069 + \$4,320 $\times$ (1-34%) = \$7,920
:::
:::

## Step 3: Calculating EVA®

-   Suppose that you calculated a Weighted Average Cost of Capital of 9.5%

-   Then, we can calculate EVA® as:

. . .

$$
\text{EVA} = \text{NOPAT}-\text{WACC}\times \text{Operating Capital}
$$

Therefore, we have:

. . .

$$
\text{EVA} = 7,920-0.095\times99,000=7,920-9,405=-1,485
$$

-   A [profitable]{.green} firm, after considering its [Cost of Equity]{.blue}, may be [destroying]{.red} value!
    1.  Net Income: [+\$5,069]{.green}\
    2.  EVA: [-\$1,485]{.red}

## Return on Invested Capital

-   Another way to compare and contrast returns and the opportunity cost of capital is to calculate the [Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)]{.blue}:

. . .

$$
ROIC=\dfrac{\text{NOPAT}}{\text{Operating Capital}}=\dfrac{7,920}{99,000}=8\%
$$

-   We see that the resulting return is [lower]{.red} than the cost of capital. We can recalculate the EVA:

. . .

$$
\small EVA= (ROIC-WACC)\times \text{Operating Capital}\rightarrow(8\%-9.5\%)\times 99,000= -1,485
$$

-   Finally, we can also decompose ROIC in terms of [Operating Margin]{.blue} and [Operating Turnover]{.blue}:

. . .

$$
\small
ROIC=\dfrac{NOPAT}{Sales}\times\dfrac{Sales}{\text{Operating Capital}}\rightarrow 6\%\times 1.22= 8\%
$$

## Practical thoughts on EVA

-   All in all, how to improve a company's EVA? We saw that EVA can be calculated as:

. . .

$$
EVA=(\text{ROIC}-\text{WACC})\times \text{Operating Capital}
$$

1.  **Margins**

    -   Increase revenues
    -   Seek for efficiencies in operating costs

2.  **Turnover**

    -   Increase Sales
    -   Decrease the level of Assets needed to generate sales
    -   Allocate capital towards more productive assets

## Market Value Added (MVA)

-   If EVA is expected to be positively correlated with increases in value, then we can think about the amount of added value that a firm has in the stock market in terms of expected EVAs:

1.  [The Market-Value-Added]{.blue} is the difference between [Market Value]{.blue} and [Book Value]{.blue} of Equity:

. . .

$$
\small MVA= \text{Market Value of Equity} - \text{Book Value of Equity}
$$ 2. Now, *in equilibirum*, we should expected if the [Market Value of Equity]{.blue} to be the [Book Value of Equity]{.blue} plus all the expected EVAs:

. . .

$$
\small MVA^\star \approx \underbrace{\text{B.V of Equity}+\dfrac{\sum_{t=1}^{\infty}\text{EVA}_{t}}{(1+r)^t}}_{\text{Market Value of Equity}}-\text{B.V Equity}\rightarrow MVA^\star \approx\dfrac{\sum_{t=1}^{\infty}\text{EVA}_{t}}{(1+r)^t}
$$

## Potential Dynamics - MVA
