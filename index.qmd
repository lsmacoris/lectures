Within this section, you'll find an organized repository containing my lecture notes from FGV-EAESP, technical handouts, and illustrative code samples. Most, if not all, of these resources extensively leverage [Quarto](www.quarto.org), an open-source scientific and technical publishing system that supports *R*, *Python*, *Julia*, and *Observable*. Quarto offers a seamless and scalable solution for sharing technical content, encompassing a blend of plain text and executable code, being applicable to static document formats like .pdf files and dynamic, interactive presentations facilitated by [Reveal JS](https://revealjs.com/).

For comprehensive guidance on harnessing Quarto for presentations and technical content in a standardized and comprehensive manner, please refer to the official [reference](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/) material.
