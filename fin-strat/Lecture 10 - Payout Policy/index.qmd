## Distributions to Shareholders

::: callout-important
### Definition

[Payout Policy]{.blue} is the the way a firm chooses between alternative ways to distribute free cash flow to its equityholders\]
:::

![](Images/F1.png){fig-align="center" width="75%"}

## Dividends and Share Repurchases

-   There are basically two ways by which a firm can return free cash flow to its shareholders:

    1.  By paying out as a [dividend]{.blue}, where the firm literally provides an *influx* of cash to its existing shareholders
    2.  By [repurchasing existing shares]{.blue}, a firm can return cash to its shareholders

-   Importantly, in Brazil, there are two important aspects that need to be taken into consideration:

    1.  Apart from dividends, we also have [interest on equity]{.blue} (*"Juros sobre o Capital Próprio - JCP"*)
    2.  Furthermore, in most countries, investors pay taxes over dividends and over capital gains. In Brazil, [dividends are not taxed]{.blue}

. . .

$\rightarrow$ *In this lecture, we will study each of these options, understand their main aspects, usages, and discuss how they relate to a firm's capital structure decision*

## Dividends

-   The most straightforward way to return cash to the shareholders of a firm is through the payment of [dividends]{.blue}

. . .

::: callout-important
### Definition

[Dividends]{.blue} are the compensation (in cash) that firms provide to its shareholders. Apart from capital gains (*i.e*, the appreciation of the share price over time), shareholders can also benefit from receiving a *cash influx* related to the excess cash from the firm's operations
:::

-   But how do firms decide *how much* to pay in dividends?

    1.  A public company’s board of directors determines the amount of the firm’s dividend
    2.  The board sets the amount per share that will be paid and decides when the payment will occur

-   Note that dividends *need not be* limited to the net income generated by a firm - in fact, some firms issue additional equity or debt to pay out as dividends

## Dividends - a practical timeline

![](Images/F2.png){fig-align="center" width="55%"}

1.  [Declaration Date]{.blue}: the date on which the board of directors authorizes the payment

2.  [Ex-Dividend Date]{.blue}: a date, two days prior to a dividend's record date, on or after which anyone buying the stock will not be eligible for the dividend

3.  [Record Date]{.blue}: when a firm pays a dividend, only shareholders on record on this date receive

4.  [Payable Date (Distribution Date)]{.blue}: a date, generally within a month after the record date, on which a firm mails dividend checks to its registered stockholders

## Types of divends

-   Apart from the important marks within the timeline of a dividend distribution, firm's can distribute dividends in a variety of ways:

1.  [Regular Dividends]{.blue}: *often* paid every quarter

2.  [Special Dividend]{.blue}: a one-time dividend payment a firm makes, which is usually much *larger* than a regular dividend

3.  [Stock Split (Stock Dividend)]{.blue}: when a company issues a dividend in *shares of stock* rather than cash to its shareholders

4.  [Liquidation Dividend]{.blue}: when the dividend is paid while liquidating the firm's business. Contrary to the others, it is taxed as capital gain

## Share Repurchases

::: callout-important
### Definition

[Share Repurchases] are an alternative way to pay cash to investors is through a share repurchase or buyback. In short, the firm uses cash to buy shares of its own outstanding stock.
:::

-   Like dividends, there are several ways in which a firm may operationalize share repurchases. The most common terms are:

    1.  [Open Market Repurchases]{.blue}: when a firm repurchases shares in the open market - these represent about $\small95\%$ of all repurchase transactions

    2.  [Tender Offer]{.blue}: a *public announcement* to all existing security holders to buy back a specified amount of outstanding securities at a given price (typically set at a $\small10\%$ to $\small20\%$ premium to the current market price) over a prespecified period of time. If shareholders do not tender enough shares, the firm may cancel the offer, and no buyback occurs

    3.  [Targeted Repurchase]{.blue}: when a firm purchases shares directly from a specific shareholder

## Interest on Equity

-   In Brazil, there is also a possibility of paying [interest on equity]{.blue}: this used to be an important instrument when inflation rates were very high in Brazil. The goal was to create an incentive to hold equity when inflation was high:

    1.  Interest on equity is *tax deductible* at the corporate level but subject to a withholding tax at the shareholder level
    2.  From an accounting perspective, interest on equity is treated similarly to interest (to creditors)

-   The tax rate is different for different types of investors. Usually, the interest on equity tax rate is lower than the corporate tax rate

-   Firms have a limit to pay as interest on equity. This limit increases every year by *TJLP*, an annual interest rate established by Brazilian Central Bank - [access here](https://www.in.gov.br/web/dou/-/comunicado-n-39.215-de-30-de-setembro-de-2022-433423675)

## Dividends *versus* Share Repurchases

-   When it comes to payout policy, an important question relates to the *method* in which cash will be returned to shareholders - pay out as a [dividend]{.blue} or through [share repurchases]{.blue}?

-   To see that, assume that the board of *Genron Corporation* is meeting to decide how to pay out $\small \$20$ million in excess cash to shareholders. The firms has no debt, and its equity cost of capital equals its unlevered cost of capital of $\small 12\%$

-   There are $\small 10$ million shares outstanding, and the estimated free cash flows for the upcoming years are $\small \$48$ million per year

-   Which option (if any) should be the preferred one?

    1.  Paying out as dividends
    2.  Share repurchases

-   As a starting point, assume that there are no market imperfections - *i.e*, [Perfect Capital Markets]{.blue}

## Option 1: Dividends

-   With $\small 10$ million shares, *Genron* will be able to pay a dividend of $\small \$20/10=\$2$ per share

-   The firm expects to generate future free cash flows of $\small\$48$ million per year. Therefore, it anticipates paying a dividend of $\small \$4.80$ per share each year thereafter

-   As a result, the value to *equityholders* is:

. . .

$$
\small \underbrace{2}_{\text{Payment today}} + \underbrace{\sum_{t=1}^{\infty}\dfrac{4.80}{(1+12\%)}}_{\text{Perpetuity}} \rightarrow 2 + \frac{4.80}{12\%} = 2 + 40 = 42
$$

-   *After* the $\small \$2$ dividend payment, the value of each share is simply $\small \$42-\$2=\$40$ per share. Notice that after the dividend payment, the share price drops by the dividend per share value

. . .

$\rightarrow$ *In a perfect capital market, when a dividend is paid, the share price drops by the amount of the dividend when the stock begins to trade ex-dividend*

## Option 2: Share Repurchase

-   Instead of paying a dividend this year, *Genron* can use the $\small 20$ million to repurchase its shares on the open market. In this case, the company can buy $\small \$20/\$42 = 0.476$ million shares

-   Therefore, the new number of outstanding shares are: $\small 10 - 0.476 = 9.524$ million. Note that this has *not changed* the free cash flow available to shareholders, but now, there are less shareholders to be paid for! After the repurchase, the future dividend value is:

. . .

$$
\small \dfrac{\text{Free Cash Flow}}{\text{# of Shares}}=\dfrac{48,000,000}{9,524,000} = 5.04 \text{ per share}
$$

-   Therefore, the stock price is $\small \frac{\$5.04}{12\%}=\$42$ per share

. . .

$\rightarrow$ *In perfect capital markets, an open market share repurchase has no effect on the stock price, and the stock price is the same as the cum-dividend*[^1] price if a dividend were paid instead.

[^1]: *When a stock trades before the ex-dividend date, entitling anyone who buys the stock to the dividend (\$42 in this example).*

## Comparing the options

-   An important implication of [Perfect Capital Markets]{.blue} is that investors should be [indifferent]{.blue} between the firm distributing funds via [dividends]{.blue} or [share repurchases]{.blue}:

    1.  When receiving via [dividends]{.blue}, they receive a cash payment of $\small \$2$ and keep the value of their shares trading at $\small \$40$
    2.  Via share repurchases, regardless of tendering their shares, share prices are the same ($\small \$ 42$)

-   From a purely value perspective, both alternatives yield the same value. As in previous lectures, a similar argument can be made when assuming [perfect capital markets]{.blue}: if investors have preferences over a given option, they can make a [homemade dividend]{.blue}^[See the *Appendix* for a detailed example on homemade dividends.]

    -   If the firm [repurchases]{.blue} shares and the investor wants [cash]{.blue}, the investor can raise cash by [selling]{.blue} his/her shares
    -   If the firm pays a [dividend]{.blue} and the investor prefers [stock]{.blue}, they can use the dividend to purchase additional fractional shares

. . .

## Dividends *versus* Share Repurchases, alternative policy

-   What if, as opposed to the first option, *Genror* decides to pay a [higher]{.blue} dividend? To see that, suppose that the firm wants to pay dividends [larger]{.blue} than $\small\$2$ per share right now, but it only has $\small 20$ million in cash today

-   Thus, *Genron* needs an additional $\small\$28$ million to pay the larger dividend now. To do this, the firm decides to raise the cash by selling new shares. Given a current share price of $\small\$42$, the firm could raise $\small \$28$ million by issuing $\small \$28/\$42= \$0.67$ million new shares

-   The new dividend per share is: $\small \$48/10.67=\$4.5$. The *cum-dividend* share price is:

. . .

$$
\small \underbrace{4.5}_{\text{Actual Dividend}} + \underbrace{\frac{4.5}{12\%}}_{\text{Perpetuity}}= 4.5 + 37.5 = 42
$$

$\rightarrow$ *As issuing new equity does not change the free cash flows, stock price does not change as a result of the share repurchase!*

## Modigliani and Miller and the Dividend Policy Irrelevance

-   Note that there is a *tradeoff* between [current]{.blue} and [future]{.blue} dividends:

    1.  If Genron pays a [higher]{.green} current dividend, future dividends will be [lower]{.red}
    2.  If Genron pays a [lower]{.red} current dividend, future dividends will be [higher]{.green}

-   Regardless of the payout policy, shareholders can create a *homemade dividend* on their own, matching his/her specific payout preferences, by buying or selling shares themselves

-   Therefore, the only factor that determines a firm's payout policy is the [free cash flow]{.blue}.

. . .

:::{.callout-important}
### Definition
[The Dividend Policy Irrelevance Condition]{.blue}: in perfect capital markets, holding fixed the investment policy, the firm's choice of dividend policy is irrelevant and does not affect the initial share price. While dividends do determine share prices, a firm's choice of dividend policy does not.

:::



## Payout Policy in Practice

-   Based on our discussion, [when we assume that capital markets are perfect]{.blue}, the payout policy is only determined by the firm's future cash flows, and the specific type of payment and timing are *irrelevant* to determine the firm's value

-   In reality, capital markets are *not* perfect:

    1.  Some types of payout may have higher costs than others, such as taxes
    2.  There could be limits and/or regulations around a given payout type
    3.  Finally, different payout policies may be subject to a different degree of information asymmetry

-   As a result, if the firm's payout policy is relevant to determine the firm's value, [it is only due to these imperfections]{.blue}!

. . .

$\rightarrow$ *In what follows, we will look at the most important market imperfections that would make the firm's payout policy relevant to the firm's value*

## The Tax Disadvantage of Dividends

-   First and foremost, there could be differences in the taxation of *Dividends* and *Capital Gains*
    1.  Shareholders must pay [taxes on the dividends]{.blue} they receive, and they must also pay [capital gains taxes]{.blue} when they sell their shares
    2.  Dividends are typically taxed at a higher rate than capital gains[^2]. In fact, long-term investors can defer the capital gains tax forever by not selling shares

[^2]: In Brazil, dividends are *not* taxed.

. . .

1.  The [higher]{.blue} the [tax rate on dividends]{.blue}, the more undesirable is for a firm to raise funds to pay a dividend
2.  When dividends are taxed at a higher rate than capital gains, if a firm raises money by issuing shares and then gives that money back to shareholders as a dividend, shareholders are hurt because they will receive less than their initial investment

## The Tax Disadvantage of Dividends, continued

-   To see that, assume that a firm raises $\small\$25$ million from shareholders and uses it to pay $\small\$25$ million in dividends. Dividends are taxed at a $\small39\%$ tax rate, and Capital Gains are taxed at a $\small20\%$ tax rate. We then have the following cases:

    1.  In terms of [dividend taxes]{.blue}, shareholders will owe $\small 39\% \times \$25 = 9.75$ million in taxes

    2.  Because the firm value falls after dividend, the capital gain (when selling shares) will be $\small \$25$ million less, lowering the [capital gains taxes]{.blue} by $\small 20\% \times \$25 = \$5$ million

-   Shareholders will pay a total of $\small \$9.75 − \$5.00 = \$4.75$ million in taxes

-   Shareholders will receive back only $\small \$25 − \$4.75 = 20.25$ million

## The Dividend Puzzle

-   By the rationale shown before, when the [tax rate on dividends]{.blue} is [greater]{.blue} than the [tax rate on capital gains]{.blue}, shareholders will pay [lower]{.green} taxes if a firm uses share repurchases rather than dividends

-   This tax savings will increase the value of a firm that uses share repurchases rather than dividends. As a consequence, the [optimal dividend policy]{.blue} when the dividend tax rate exceeds the capital gain tax rate is to pay [no dividends at all]{.blue}

. . .

$\rightarrow$ *In reality, however, firms continue to issue dividends despite their tax disadvantage - also known as the ["Dividend Puzzle"]{.blue}. **Why?** *


## Dividend Capture and Tax Clienteles

-   The preference for share repurchases rather than dividends depends on the difference between the dividend tax rate and the capital gains tax rate

-   [The Effective Dividend Tax Rate]{.blue}: consider buying a stock just before it goes *ex*-dividend and selling the stock just after. The equilibrium condition is:

. . .

$$
\small (P_{\text{Cum}}-P_{\text{Ex}})\times\underbrace{(1-\tau_g)}_{\text{Net of Capital Gain Taxes}} = D\times \underbrace{(1-\tau_d)}_{\text{Net of Dividend Taxes}}
$$

-   Rearranging terms, we have;

. . .

$$
\small P_{\text{Cum}}-P_{\text{Ex}} = \frac{D\times(1-\tau_d)}{1-\tau_g} \rightarrow D \times \bigg[ 1 - \frac{\tau_d - \tau_g}{1-\tau_g}  \bigg]
$$

## Dividend Capture and Tax Clienteles

$$
\small P_{\text{Cum}}-P_{\text{Ex}} = D \times \bigg[ 1 - \frac{\tau_d - \tau_g}{1-\tau_g}  \bigg]
$$

-   If we set $\tau^*_d = \frac{\tau_d - \tau_g}{1-\tau_g}$, we have that:

. . .

$$
\small P_{\text{Cum}}-P_{\text{Ex}} = D \times (1-\tau^*_d)
$$

-   $\small \tau^\star_d$ measures the additional tax paid by the investor per dollar of after-tax capital gains income that is received as a dividend. Assuming $\small \tau_g=15\%$ and $\small \tau_d=30\%$:

. . .

$$
\small \tau^*_d = \frac{0.30 - 0.15}{1-0.15} = 0.176
$$

$\rightarrow$ *In words, there is a significant tax disadvantage of dividends: each* $\small \$1$ of dividends is worth only $\small\$0.824$ in capital gains.

## Dividend Capture and Tax Clienteles

-   In practice, $\tau_d^\star$, the effective dividend tax rate, [differs across investors for a variety of reasons]{.blue}:

    1.  Income Levels
    2.  Investment Horizons
    3.  Tax Jurisdictions
    4.  Types of Investor or Type of investment Account

-   As a result of their different tax rates, investors will have varying preferences regarding dividends. This opens room for firms to try matching their payout policy to the preferences of investors:

    1.  The [Clientele Effect]{.blue} is when the dividend policy of a firm reflects the tax preference of its investor clientele
    2.  For example, individuals in the highest tax brackets have a preference for stocks that pay no or low dividends, whereas tax-free investors and corporations have a preference for stocks with high dividends

$\rightarrow$ *The increase in volume  consistent with tax-exempt traders buying before the ex-date and selling it afterwards. Price hikes may have to do with signaling - see more in the upcoming slides*

## Payout Versus Retention of Cash

-   As of now, we discussed why firms may not be indifferent regarding different *payout options* (*i.e.*, dividends *versus* share repurchases)

-   Another strand of the discussion relates to the decision to [payout]{.blue} or [retain]{.blue} free cash flow:

    1.  In [perfect capital markets]{.blue}, once a firm has taken all positive-NPV projects, it is indifferent between saving excess cash and paying it out

    2.  However, when such market imperfections do exist, there will be an important *trade-off*: while retaining cash can reduce the costs of raising capital in the future, but it can also increase taxes and agency costs

. . .

$\rightarrow$ *As a result, the extent to which a firm will prefer one or the other will depend on the trade-off between the benefits and costs of retaining cash!*

## Payout *versus* Retention of Cash in Perfect Capital Markets

-   If a firm has already taken all [positive]{.green}-NPV projects, any additional projects it takes on are zero or negative-NPV projects
    1.  Rather than wasting excess cash on [negative]{.red}-NPV projects, a firm can use the cash to purchase financial assets

    2.  In perfect capital markets, buying and selling securities is a zero-NPV transaction, so it should not affect firm value
    
- This indifference is also known as the *Payout Irrelevance Condition*

. . .

:::{.callout-important}
### Definition

The [Modigliani-Miller Payout Irrelevance]{.blue}: with perfect capital markets, the retention versus payout decision is irrelevant. In perfect capital markets, if a firm invests excess cash flows in financial securities, the firm's choice of payout versus retention is irrelevant and does not affect the initial share price.
:::

## Payout Versus Retention of Cash, practice

*Payne Enterprises has* $\small\$20,000$ in excess cash. Payne is considering investing the cash in one-year Treasury bill paying $\small5\%$ interest and then using the cash to pay a dividend next year. Alternatively, the firm can pay a dividend immediately, and shareholders can invest the cash on their own. In a perfect capital market, which option will shareholders prefer?

. . .

$\rightarrow$ **Solution**:

. . .

1.  If Payne pays an *immediate dividend*, the shareholders receive $\small\$20,000$ today
2.  If Payne *retains the cash*, at the end of one year the company will be able to pay a dividend of $\small \$20,000 \times (1+5\%)=\$21,000$

-   Finally, note that if shareholders invest in Treasury bills themselves, they would also have $\small\$21,000$ at the end of one year

-   In either case, investors have the [same]{.blue} payoff!

## Corporate Taxes and Cash Retention, practice

-   What happens to the *trade-off* between dividends and cash retention when we assume that there are market imperfections?

    1.  An important market imperfection relates to [Corporate Taxes]{.blue}: these takes make it *costly* for a firm to retain excess cash

    2.  From a valuation perspective, cash is equivalent to negative leverage, so the tax advantage of leverage implies a tax disadvantage to holding cash

-   In this scenario, whenever market imperfections are present, firms may not be indifferent between receivind dividends and retaining cash anymore!

## Corporate Taxes and Cash Retention, practice

-   To see that, assume that *Payne* has a marginal tax rate of $\small39\%$. Would a [tax-exempt]{.blue} endowment prefer that *Payne* use its excess cash to pay the dividend immediately or invest the cash in a Treasury bill paying $\small5\%$ interest and then pay out a dividend?

. . .

$\rightarrow$ **Solution**:

1.  If *Payne* pays a [dividend]{.blue} today, shareholders receive $\small\$20,000$

2.  If *Payne* [retains]{.blue} the cash for one year, it will earn an after-tax return on the Treasury bills of $\small 5\% \times (1-0.39\%)=3.05\%$

-   Therefore, *Payne* will pay a dividend of $\small\$20,000 \times (1+3.05\%) = 20,610$, which is *less* than the $\small\$21,000$ the endowment would have earned if they had invested in the Treasury bills themselves!

## Investor Taxes and Cash Retention

-   The decision to pay out versus retain cash may also affect the [taxes paid by shareholders]{.blue}:
    1.  When a firm *retains* cash, it must pay corporate tax on the interest it earns on that cash. In addition, the investor will owe capital gains tax on the increased firm value. The interest on retained cash is taxed twice
    2.  If the firm *paid the cash* to its shareholders instead, they could invest it and be taxed only once on the interest that they earn
-   The cost of retaining cash thus depends on the *combined effect* of the corporate and capital gains taxes, compared to the tax on interest income:

. . .

$$
\small \tau^*_{\text{Retain}} = 1-\frac{(1-\tau_c)(1-\tau_g)}{(1-\tau_i)}
$$

## Issuance and Distress Costs

-   Besides any tax considerations, firms retain cash balances to cover potential future cash shortfalls, despite the tax disadvantage to retaining cash:

    1.  A firm might accumulate a large cash balance if there is a reasonable chance that future earnings will be insufficient to fund future positive-NPV investment opportunities
    2.  The cost of holding cash to cover potential shortfalls should be compared to the reduction in transaction, agency, and adverse selection costs of raising capital through new issuances

-   However, there are also [Agency Costs of Retaining Cash]{.blue}:

    1.  When firms have excessive cash, managers may use the funds inefficiently by paying excessive executive perks, over-paying for acquisitions, etc
    2.  Paying out excess cash through dividends or share repurchases, rather than retaining cash, can boost the stock price by reducing managers' ability and temptation to waste resources

. . .

$\rightarrow$ *The optimal payout policy trades-off these benefits against agency costs!*

## Payout Versus Retention of Cash, practice

*Altgreen is an all-equity firm with* $\small\$250$ million shares outstanding. It has $\small\$300$ million in cash and expects future free cash flows of $\small\$150$ million per year. Management plans to use the cash to expand the firm's operations, which will in turn increase future free cash flows by $\small10\%$. If the cost of capital of Altgreen's investments is $\small7\%$, how would a decision to use the cash for a share repurchase rather than the expansion change the share price?

. . .

$\rightarrow$ **Solution**:

. . .

-   If *Altgreen* uses the cash to [expand]{.blue}, its future free cash flows will increase by $\small10\%$ to $\small\$165$ million per year. Using the perpetuity formula, its market value will be:

. . .

$$
\small \dfrac{165}{7\%} = 2.357 \text{ billion, or } \dfrac{2.357}{250} = 9.43 \text{ per share}
$$

## Payout Versus Retention of Cash, practice


-   If, on the other hand, *Altgreen* [does not expand]{.blue}, the value of its future free cash flows will be $\small 150/7\% = \$2.143$ billion. Adding cash, we have $\small \$2.443/250 = \$9.77$ per share. When repurchasing shares, it will repurchase $\small \$300/\$9.77=30.71$ million shares:

. . .

$$
\small \dfrac{2.143}{219.29}= 9.77 \text{ per share}
$$


- All in all, note that the firm could avoid a [negative]{.red} NPV project by retaining cash/share repurchases:

. . .

$$
\small \underbrace{-300}_{\text{Cash}}+\underbrace{\dfrac{15}{7\%}}_{\text{Growth Option}}=-300+214=-75 
$$

. . .

$\rightarrow$ *The decrease of $\small \$75$ million in value matches the $\small 75/250\approx \$0.34$ decrease in stock price!*

## Signaling with Payout Policy

-   In theory, we would expect dividends to trend with earnings. In practice, however firms change dividends infrequently, and dividends are much less volatile than earnings. **Why**?

-   As with *Debt*, *Dividends* can also be used as a way to *signal* information to the market. We call [Dividend Smoothing]{.blue} the practice of maintaining relatively constant dividends

-   The [Dividend Signaling Hypothesis]{.blue} is the idea that dividend changes reflect managers' views about future earnings:
      1.  When a firm [increases]{.green} dividend, it sends a positive signal to investors that they expect to be able to afford the higher dividend for the foreseeable future
      2.  When a firm [decreases]{.red} dividend, it may signal that they have given up hope that earnings will rebound in the near term and so need to save cash

- **If that is true, what is the price reaction to dividends?** Although an increase of a firm's dividend may signal optimism regarding its future cash flows, it might also signal a [lack of investment opportunities]{.red}, which might lead to a positive stock price reaction!

## Dividend Smoothing in practice (U.S. markets)

![](Images/F4.png){fig-align='center' width=60%}

$\rightarrow$ *It is possible to see that, for GM, dividend dynamics were much more stable than earnings*

## Signaling and Share Repurchases

-   Like [Dividends]{.blue}, [Share Repurchases]{.blue} can be also be seen as a credible signal the current shares are *underpriced*, as if they were *overpriced*, a share repurchase would be costly for current shareholders

-   Notwithstanding, a firm may announce a share repurchase program but not repurchase any shares, while on the other hand, when a firm announces dividends payment, it has a commitment to pay:

    1.  If investors believe that managers have better information regarding the firm's prospects and act on behalf of current shareholders, then investors will react [positively]{.green} to share repurchase announcements

    2.  Notwithstanding, announcing a share repurchase today does not necessarily represent a long-term commitment to repurchase shares in the future. Because of that, [Dividends]{.blue} have a stronger, more credible signal than [Share Repurchases]{.blue}


## Stock Dividends

-   As discussed before, with a stock dividend, a firm [does not pay out any cash]{.blue} to shareholders. As a result, the total market value of the firm's equity is unchanged

-   The only thing that is different is the [number of shares outstanding]{.blue}. The **stock price will therefore fall** because the same total equity value is now divided over a larger number of shares

-   To see that, suppose that *Genron* firm paid a $\small50\%$ stock dividend rather than a cash dividend

    1.  A shareholder who owns $\small\$100$ shares as $\small\$42$ before the dividend has a portfolio worth $\small \$4,200$
    2.  After the dividend, the shareholder owns $\small150$ shares

-   Because the portfolio is still worth $\small4,200$, the stock price will fall to $\small \$4,200/150=\$28$.

-   Sometimes, firms finance new shares. So, it is like shareholders have received cash and immediately bought new shares. In this case, decline in price is not as large as above

## Stock Splits

-   Splits are known as situations where a firm a smaller pool of highly valued shares share into a higher number of shares

-   The typical motivation for a stock split is to keep the share price in a range thought to be attractive to small investors:

    1.  If the share price rises *"too high"*, it might be difficult for small investors to invest
    2.  Keeping the price *"low"* may make the stock more attractive to small investors and increase the stock's demand and liquidity, which may in turn boost the stock price

-   **On average**, announcements of stock splits are associated with a small [increase]{.green} in prices

-   On the other hand, when the price of a company's stock falls too low and the company reduces the number of outstanding shares, $\small 2$ shares become $\small 1$ of twice the previous price - also known as *reverse split* or *insplit*

## Stock Splits in Practice - U.S. market

$\rightarrow$ *Most stocks in the U.S. market trade between $\small \$5-\$20$, which is consistent with firms keeping a reasonable range to boost liquidity and avoid excessive volatility in returns*

## Spin-Offs

-   When a firm sells a subsidiary by selling shares in the subsidiary alone. That is, the parent turns a subsidiary into a separate company

-   For instance, *Itaú*-*XP* spin-off:

    1.  *Itaú* could have sold *XP* and paid cash as dividends

    2.  Instead, *Itaú*'s current shareholders received a given number of *XP*'s stocks per share they hold of *Itaú*

-   Spin-offs mainly offer [two]{.blue} advantages:

    -   It avoids the transaction costs associated with the actual sale
    -   The special dividend is not taxed as a cash distribution. Investors will only pay capital gains taxes when they sell the received stocks

## Appendix

## Creating a homemade dividend 

*Suppose Genron does not adopt the third alternative policy, and instead pays a 2 dividend per share today. Show how an investor holding* $\small 2,000$ shares could create a homemade dividend of $\small \$4.5\times 2,000=\$9,000$ per year on her own.

. . .
 
$\rightarrow$ **Solution**

-   If Genron pays a $\small\$2$ dividend, the investor receives $\small \$4,000$ in cash and holds the rest in stock. Therefore, To receive $\small \$9,000$ in total today, she can raise an additional $\small \$5,000$ by selling $\small 125$ shares at $\small \$40$ per share just after the dividend is paid

-   In future years, *Genron* will pay a dividend of $\small \$4.80$ per share. Because she will own $\small 2,000 − 125 = 1,875$ shares, the investor will receive dividends of $\small 1,875 \times 4.80 = 9,000$ per year from then on

## Creating a homemade dividend, continued 

*Suppose you own* $\small1,000$ shares in a firm that has historically paid dividends at a rate of $\small 50\%$ of earnings per share. Although earnings per share this year are $\small\$5$, the firm has decided to retain all of the earnings and not pay a dividend. The current market price is $\$50$ per share. How could you create a homemade dividend based on the firm's dividend history?

. . .

$\rightarrow$ **Solution**

-   Based on the firm's history, its *"normal"* dividend would have been $\$5 × 50\% = \$2.50$ per share. To create a homemade dividend, you need to sell enough shares to generate the desired cash flow:

. . .

$$
\small \underbrace{1,000}_{\text{Number of Shares}} \times \underbrace{2.50}_{\text{Dividend per Share}} = 2,500
$$

-   Therefore, given a current market value of $\small\$50$ per share, you would need to sell $\small \$2,500/\$50=50$ shares to create the desired homemade dividend
