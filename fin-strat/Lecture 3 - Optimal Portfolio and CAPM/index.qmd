# From Assets to Portfolios

## The Expected Return of a two-stock portfolio

-   Previously, we looked at returns from [individual]{.blue} assets, but investors are always looking for ways to invest in [multiple]{.blue} assets at the same time. What if you hold a [portfolio]{.blue} of $n$ assets?

-   Let's keep it simple for now. Suppose you have a two-stock [portfolio]{.blue} of assets that hipotetically consists of:

    1.  [Amazon (AMZN)]{.blue} 40% of the portfolio, 10% return and standard deviation (volatility) of 25%
    2.  [Ferrari (RACE)]{.blue}: 60% of the portfolio, 15% return and stardard deviation (volatility) of 30%

-   If your portfolio is 40% [Amazon]{.blue} and 60% [Ferrari]{.blue}, then the return of your portfolio, $R_p$ is:

. . .

$$\small R_p= \sum_{i=1}^{2}\big(x_i\times R_i\big)=(0.4 \times 10\%) +(0.6 \times 15\%) = 13\%$$

. . .

$\rightarrow$ *In other words, the return of a portfolio is the weighted average of the individual asset returns!*

## The Expected Return of a two-stock portfolio, continued

::: callout-important
### Important

The weights are selected by the investors and may change over time if the prices change (unless the investor actively rebalances it to match the same proportion by buying/selling). Without trading, the weights increase for those stocks whose returns exceed the portfolio's return.
:::

-   To see that, assume that your initial holdings are \$100,000:

    1.  If [Amazon]{.blue} is 40% of the portfolio with a 10% return $\small \rightarrow 40,000\times (1+10\%)=44,000$
    2.  If [Ferrari]{.blue} is 60% of the portfolio with a 15% return $\small \rightarrow 60,000\times (1+15\%)=69,000$

-   Your holdings are now worth $\small 44,000 + 69,000= 113,000$, which yields the 13% return, but now the weights from each stock are different:

    1.  [Amazon]{.blue} holdings are $\small \frac{44}{113}\approx 38.9\%$ of the portfolio
    2.  [Ferrari]{.blue} holdings are $\small \frac{69}{113}\approx 61.1\%$ of the portfolio

## Volatility of a two-stock portfolio

-   As we now have a portfolio of two different assets, what should be the volatility? Recall that:

    1.  [Amazon (AMZN)]{.blue}'s standard deviation (volatility) was hipothetically 25%
    2.  [Ferrari (RACE)]{.blue}'s stardard deviation (volatility) was hipothetically 30%

-   As we'll see in the next slides, to compute the standard deviation of a portfolio, [we cannot rely on the weighted average]{.blue} anymore!

-   In order to see that, let's look at the historical prices from both stocks and compare:

    1.  The price trend from [Amazon]{.blue}
    2.  The price trend from [Ferrari]{.blue}
    3.  The dollar holdings for a portfolio of \$100 that holds 40% [Amazon]{.blue} and 60% [Ferrari]{.blue}

-   In what follows, we'll see how these dynamics shed light on the covariance of the portfolio

## Practice {visibility="hidden"}

-   We'll be using stock-price information collected through *Yahoo! Finance* to conduct all exercises of this lecture.

-   I have already downloaded the daily closing prices (adjusted) from [AMZN]{.blue} and [RACE]{.blue} for the full 2023 calendar year

-   We'll be going back and forth with the calculations using the data contained in this spreadsheet

. . .

## Volatility of a two-stock portfolio, summary statistics

-   If we now look at the annualized statistics, we see that..

. . .

```{r}
#| fig-align: center

cbind(do.call('cbind',Returns),(0.4*Returns[[1]]+0.6*Returns[[2]]))%>%
  setNames(c(tickers,'Portfolio'))%>%
  as.data.frame()%>%
  gather(key='Asset',value='Returns')%>%
  group_by(Asset)%>%
  summarize(`Annualized Return`= prod(1+Returns)-1,
            `Annualized Volatility` = sd(Returns)*sqrt(250))%>%
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric),percent,accuracy=0.01))%>%
  arrange(match(Asset, c("Portfolio", "RACE", "AMZN")))%>%
  DT::datatable(rownames=FALSE,
                options=list(dom='t',columnDefs = list(list(className = 'dt-center', targets = "_all"))))


```

1.  The weighted average between the individual volatilies is around `r (0.4*32.90 +0.6*21.24)%>%round(2)`%
2.  But our portfolio volatility is [lower]{.blue} than the individual volatilities. [Why? Diversification!]{.blue}

-   Intuitively, the returns from both stocks do not move in lockstep: whenever [Ferrari]{.blue} prices goes down, [Amazon]{.blue} prices move in a different fashion

-   In fact, the correlation between the returns of these stocks is around [`r do.call('cbind',Returns)%>%cor()%>%min()%>%round(2)`]{.blue}. In other words, these assets do not move in the same direction all the time!

## An interlude: Variance, Covariance, and Correlation

-   You can find the proofs for both definitions in the *Appendix*

. . .

::: callout-note
### Definition

::: nonincremental
1.  The Variance ($\sigma^2$) is the squared deviations of the returns from their means: $\small E[X-E(X)]^2$
2.  Covariance ($Cov$) is the expected product of the deviations of two returns from their means: $\small [X-E(X)][Y-Y(X)]$
:::
:::

::: callout-tip
### **Theorem I**: the variance of the sum of two random variables equals the sum of the variances of those random variables, plus two times their covariance:

$$
  \sigma^2(A+B) = \sigma^2_A + \sigma^2_B + 2\times Cov(A,B) 
  $$
:::

::: callout-tip
### **Theorem II**: The variance scales upon multiplication with a constant:

$$
  \sigma^2(\beta \times A ) = \beta^2\times \sigma^2_A 
  $$
:::

## Volatility of a two-stock portfolio, continued

-   Let's now apply this to understand our portfolio's volatility using daily data. Define:

    1.  $\sigma^2_1$ = variance of Asset 1 ([Amazon]{.blue}).
    2.  $\sigma^2_2$ = variance of Asset 2 ([Ferrari]{.blue})
    3.  $\sigma_{1,2}$ = covariance between both assets
    4.  $w_1$ and $w_2$ are the weights for both assets

-   Using the definitions highlighted before, that the variance of our portfolio returns, $R_p$, is:

. . .

$$
\small \sigma^2(R_p)=\sigma^2(w_1\times R_1+w_2\times R_2)=w_1^2\times \sigma^2_1 + w_2^2 \times \sigma^2_1 + 2\times w_1\times w_2\times \sigma_{1,2}
$$

## Variance in terms of correlation

-   We can further simplify this using the fact that the Covariance is the product of the assets' standard deviations and their correlation:

. . .

$$
\small \sigma^2(R_p)=w_1^2\times \sigma^2_1 + w_2^2 \times \sigma^2_1 + 2\times w_1\times w_2\times \underbrace{Cov(R_1,R_2)}_{\sigma_1 \times \sigma_2 \times Corr_{12}}\\
\small = \underbrace{w_1^2\times \sigma^2_1}_{1} + \underbrace{w_2^2 \times \sigma^2_1}_{2} + \underbrace{2\times w_1\times w_2\times \sigma_1 \times \sigma_2 \times Corr_{12}}_{3}
$$

. . .

1.  The [first]{.blue} term relates to the first asset (in our case, [Amazon]{.blue}) variance and its proportion in the portfolio
2.  The [second]{.blue} term relates to the second asset (in our case, [Ferrari]{.blue}) variance and its proportion in the portfolio
3.  The [third]{.blue} term relates to the [relationship]{.blue} between both assets

## A note on sample analogues

-   Recall that we cannot rely on expectations to future outcomes and/or probabilities to calculate the expected returns of the portfolio and its volatility

-   Because of that, as we did before, we replace the expectation estimator, $E(\cdot)$, with our sample analogue, which is the sample average, and it is always *backward-looking*:

    1.  Fix a period for calculation (for example, the latest 30 days)
    2.  Calculate the risk and return using sample averages

-   To facilitate the notation, we'll always refer to it using a bar: $\overline{R}$. For example the covariance between the returns from stocks $i$ and $j$ is:

. . .

$$Cov(R_i,R_j) = \frac{\sum_{1}^{T}(R_i-\overline{R_i} ) \times (R_j-\overline{R_j})}{T-1}$$

## Getting back to our portfolio

```{r}
#| fig-align: center

cbind(do.call('cbind',Returns),(0.4*Returns[[1]]+0.6*Returns[[2]]))%>%
  setNames(c(tickers,'Portfolio'))%>%
  as.data.frame()%>%
  gather(key='Asset',value='Returns')%>%
  group_by(Asset)%>%
  summarize(`Annualized Return`= prod(1+Returns)-1,
            `Annualized Volatility` = sd(Returns)*sqrt(250))%>%
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric),percent,accuracy=0.01))%>%
  arrange(match(Asset, c("Portfolio", "RACE", "AMZN")))%>%
  DT::datatable(rownames=FALSE,
                options=list(dom='t',columnDefs = list(list(className = 'dt-center', targets = "_all"))))


```

-   Using our formula for the variance of the portfolio:

. . .

$$
\small \sigma^2_p= w_1^2\times \sigma^2_1 + w_2^2 \times \sigma^2_1 + 2\times w_1\times w_2\times \sigma_1 \times \sigma_2 \times Corr_{12}\\
\small \underbrace{\small 0.4^2\times 0.3290^2+0.6^2\times 0.2124^2}_{I} + \underbrace{2\times 0.4\times0.6\times 0.3290\times 0.2124\times 0.3886}_{II} = 0.04659402
$$

- Therefore, $\sigma_{p}$ is simply $\small \sqrt{0.04659402}=0.2159$ or 21.59\%. You could also calculate the daily portfolio variance and annualize it at the end multiplying it by $\sqrt{n}$

## Variance of a 2-stock portfolio, continued

- Looking at our formula, we have:

$$
\small \sigma^2_p= w_1^2\times \sigma^2_1 + w_2^2 \times \sigma^2_1 + 2\times w_1\times w_2\times \sigma_1 \times \sigma_2 \times Corr_{12}\\
\small \underbrace{\small 0.4^2\times 0.3290^2+0.6^2\times 0.2124^2}_{I} + \underbrace{2\times 0.4\times0.6\times 0.3290\times 0.2124\times 0.3886}_{II} = 0.04659402
$$

1.  The [first]{.blue} term ([I]{.blue}) captures the individual variances contribution
2.  The [second]{.blue} term ([II]{.blue}) captures the relationship between assets (note that 0.3312 is the correlation between both individual returns)

## Wrapping up - 2-stock portfolio volatility

-   These assets have roughly similar historical return and volatility, but they 'move' very differently:

1.  For example, when [Amazon]{.blue} performed well, [Ferrari]{.blue} did not move in lockstep
2.  As a matter of fact, their correlation is about 0.39, meaning that their prices do not trend in the same direction most of the time!

-   As you now see, the return of the portfolio is equal to the weighted average of the individual returns...

-   ...However, the volatility of is much lower than the volatility of the two individual stocks, as the assets are offseting each other and making the return "smoother"!

-   How much risk is eliminated when creating a portfolio? It depends on the degree to which the stocks face common risks and their prices move together (in mathematical terms, this will be captured by the correlation parameter, $\small Corr_{12}$!

## Volatility of a large portfolio

-   [What if we added a third asset to our portfolio?]{.blue} Let's say that you're really into discretionary goods and decide to place a bet on [Victoria's Secret (*ticker: VSCO*)]{.blue}, which had 30% of return in the previous last

-   You decided to keep the weight on [Amazon]{.blue} and split [Ferrari]{.blue} and [Victoria's Secret]{.blue} evenly, with 30% each

-   How does that play a role in your portfolio? As before, your portfolio [Return]{.blue} is simply a weighted average of the individual returns:

. . .

$$
R_{p}=\sum_{i=1}^{3}w_i\times R_i = \underbrace{(0.4 \times 10\%)}_{\text{Amazon}} +\underbrace{(0.3 \times 15\%)}_{\text{Ferrari}}+ \underbrace{(0.3 \times 25\%)}_{\text{VSCO}}\approx 16\%
$$

-   Let's see how this strategy performed from 2023 up to now!

## Ouch! You've seen to be worse off now!

```

## Your VSCO bet did not play well, unfortunately

```{r}
#| fig-align: center

cbind(do.call('cbind',Returns),(0.4*Returns[[1]]+0.3*Returns[[2]]+0.3*Returns[[3]]))%>%
  setNames(c(tickers,'Portfolio'))%>%
  as.data.frame()%>%
  gather(key='Asset',value='Returns')%>%
  group_by(Asset)%>%
  summarize(`Annualized Return`= prod(1+Returns)-1,
            `Annualized Volatility` = sd(Returns)*sqrt(250))%>%
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric),percent,accuracy=0.01))%>%
  arrange(`Annualized Volatility`)%>%
  DT::datatable(rownames=FALSE,
                options=list(dom='t',columnDefs = list(list(className = 'dt-center', targets = "_all"))))

```

-   Adding [VSCO]{.blue} to the portfolio severely hit the overall return, $\small R_p$

-   [VSCO]{.blue} was also very volatile: its standard deviation was twice as high as [Amazon]{.blue}. However, the portfolio volatility is substantially lower

-   One way to understand this is to look at the correlation matrix between the assets

## VSCO is not strongly correlated with the other assets

```{r}
#| fig-align: center

cbind(do.call('cbind',Returns))%>%
  setNames(tickers)%>%
  as.data.frame()%>%
  cor()%>%
  round(2)%>%
  DT::datatable(caption = 'Correlation Matrix',
                options=list(dom='t',columnDefs = list(list(className = 'dt-center', targets = "_all"))))

```

-   Looking at the correlation matrix, we can see that:
    1.  $\small Corr_{\text{AMZN,VSCO}}=0.16$
    2.  $\small Corr_{\text{RACE,VSCO}}=0.14$
-   As we can see, because the correlation coefficient is very small, the contribution of [VSCO]{.blue} to the overall portfolio volatility is limited

## The variance of a 3-stock portfolio

-   How can we extend your variance calculation for three assets?

-   The general formulation of the variance formula shows us that:

. . .

$$
\small  Var(X)=Var(A+B+C) = E[((A+B+C)-E(A+B+C))]^2 =\\
\small E[(\underbrace{[A-E(A)]}_{\text{First Term}}+[\underbrace{B-E(B)}_{\text{Second Term}}]+[\underbrace{C-E(C)}_{\text{Third Term}}])^2] \\
$$

-   This is a quadratic form, and we can decompose it as:

. . .

$$
\small (A+B+C)^2= A^2+B^2+C^2 + 2AB + 2AC +2BC
$$

## The variance of a 3-stock portfolio, continued

-   In portfolio terms:

. . .

$$
\small \sigma^2_p= \underbrace{w_1^2\times \sigma^2_1}_{I} + \underbrace{w_2^2 \times \sigma^2_1}_{II}
\small + \underbrace{w_3^2 \times \sigma^3_1}_{III} \\
\small + \underbrace{2\times w_1\times w_2\times \sigma_1\times\sigma_2\times Corr_{12}}_{IV} 
\small + \underbrace{2\times w_1\times w_3\times \sigma_1\times\sigma_3\times Corr_{13}}_{V}
\small + \underbrace{2\times w_2\times w_3\times \sigma_2\times\sigma_3\times Corr_{23}}_{VI}
$$

-   [I, II]{.blue}, and [III]{.blue} capture the individual stock variance contribution
-   [IV]{.blue} captures the relationship between [Amazon]{.blue} and [Ferrari]{.blue} (as before)
-   [V]{.blue} captures the relationship between [Amazon]{.blue} and [VSCO]{.blue} (new!)
-   [VI]{.blue} captures the relationship between [Ferrari]{.blue} and [VSCO]{.blue} (new!)

## The variance of a 3-stock portfolio, continued

-   Plugging in the numbers from our exercise:

. . .

$$
\small \underbrace{\small (0.4^2\times 0.3290^2)}_{I} + \underbrace{(0.3^2\times 0.2124^2)}_{II} + \underbrace{(0.3^2\times 0.5861^2)}_{III} \\
\small + \underbrace{(2\times0.4\times0.3\times0.3290\times0.2124\times0.39)}_{IV} + \underbrace{(2\times0.4\times0.3\times0.3290\times 0.5861\times0.16)}_{V} \\ 
+\small \underbrace{(2\times0.4\times0.3\times0.3290\times 0.5861\times0.14)}_{VI}=26.38\%
$$

-   Although [VSCO]{.blue} had incurred in significant losses, its returns were minimally correlated to the the stocks

## The variance of a large portfolio

-   What if you had a significantly high number $N$ of assets in a portfolio? You can generalize the previous formulas using the definition below:

. . .

::: callout-tip
### Definition

::: nonincremental
[The variance of a portfolio $P$ with $N$ stocks with weights $w_{1,2,...,N}$ is:]{.big}

$$
\sigma^2_p=\sum_{i=1}^{N}w_i^2\sigma_i^2 + 2\times\sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{j\neq i} w_i w_j \sigma_{ij}
$$

-   [Where:]{.big}
    1.  [$\sum_{i=1}^{N}w_i\sigma_i^2$ is the individual stock volatility contribution terms; and]{.big}
    2.  [$2\times\sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{j\neq i} w_i w_j \sigma_{ij}$ represents all the covariance terms from every pairwise combination of stocks in the portfolio]{.big}
:::
:::


## Volatility of a large portfolio - matrix form

- From our previous slide, we saw that the variance of a portfolio was defined as:
$$
\sigma^2_p=\sum_{i=1}^{N}w_i^2\sigma_i^2 + 2\times\sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{j\neq i} w_i w_j \sigma_{ij}
$$
- Define $\mathbf{w}$ as the vector of stock's weights, $[w_1,w_2,w_3]$ and $\Sigma$ as the covariance matrix of returns. Then, you can rewrite $\sigma^2_p$ as:

. . .

$$
\sigma^2_p = \mathbf{w}'\Sigma\mathbf{w}
$$

- In practice, writing the variance of a portfolio in matrix terms simplifies a lot of the calculations if you want to perform calculations using *Excel* with $n>2$


## Volatility of a large portfolio - a graphical representation

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](Images/F1.png)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Diagonal cells contain [variance]{.blue} terms, and the off-diagonal cells contain the [covariance]{.blue} terms
-   As $N$ assets increases, the number of terms [outside]{.blue} the main diagonal increases more than the main diagonal.
-   Therefore, the variance of a well-diversified portfolio is mostly determined by the [covariances]{.blue}, and not the individual stock variance terms!
:::
:::

## Limits to diversification

-   How much of the variance of a portfolio we can eliminate through diversification?

-   In practical terms:
    1.  So, if you increase the size of your portfolio, the risk decreases (until to a certain amount)
    2.  Usually, about half of the initial variance can be eliminated through diversification!
-   [Which type of risk is eliminated]{.blue}? Only the [idiosyncratic]{.blue} risk! For example, firm-specific characteristics
-   [Which type of risk remains]{.blue}? Only the [systematic]{.blue} risk! For example, economic conditions

. . .

# Choosing an Efficient Portfolio

## Choosing Portfolios

-   Now that we understand how to calculate the expected return and volatility of a portfolio, we can return to the main goal of the chapter: [determine how an investor can create an efficient portfolio]{.blue}

-   Let's start of with the simplest case: create a portfolio with two stocks, [Amazon]{.blue} and [Ferrari]{.blue}. Previously, we've shown that, for the analysis period, we had the following results in terms of risk and return:

. . .

## Choosing an Efficient Portfolio

-   As a financial manager, one crucial job you have is to find portfolios that are not sub-optimal
    1.  For a given level of volatility, they deliver the highest possible return
    2.  Alternatively, for a given level of return, they deliver the lowest possible volatility
-   An easy what to look at this is to identify the [minimum variance portfolio (MVP)]{.blue}
    1.  This portfolio is, among all combinations, the one with the [lowest]{.blue} volatility
    2.  From there, if a given portfolio is riskier than the [MVP]{.blue}, it [needs]{.blue} to deliver higher returns!
    3.  On the other hand, if a portfolio is riskier than the [MVP]{.blue} and deliver the same/lower returns, it can be considered [inefficient]{.red}

. . .

$\rightarrow$ In other words: investors should look only for efficient portfolios and will choose based on his specific preferences for risk!

## The Efficient Frontier

-   In our example, we used only two assets. What happens when we increase the number of potential assets?

-   Let's replicate the same rationale by now investing our money in three possible stocks: [Amazon]{.blue},[Ferrari]{.blue}, and [VSCO]{.blue}

## Choosing an Efficient Portfolio

-   What happens when you continuously increase the number of assets?

    1.  If you add stocks, you improve the frontier - *i.e*, you are able to create portfolios that span better options in terms of risk and return
    2.  If you continue adding assets, you will have what is called [Efficient Frontier]{.blue}

-   The [Efficient Frontier]{.blue} is the set of portfolios where:

    1.  [For a given level of volatility]{.blue}, you have the [highest]{.green} possible return among all portfolios with the same volalitity level
    2.  [For a given level of return]{.blue}, you have the [lowest]{.green} possible volatility among all portfolios with the same return level

-   Based on this, is there a [single]{.blue} portfolio in which all investors should hold? In practice, investors will choose among portfolios based on their specific preferences for risk and return

# Risk-Free Saving and Borrowing

## Risk-Free Saving and Borrowing

-   Thus far, we have considered the risk and return possibilities that result from combining risky investments into portfolios

-   By including all risky investments in the construction of the efficient frontier, we achieve the maximum diversification possible with risky assets

-   In practice, however, we have the existence of *risk-free* assets, such as Treasury Bills, Treasury Bonds, *Tesouro Direto* etc

-   Up to this point, we assumed that all the available assets had a minimum level of risk - for example, stocks

-   In what follows, we will investigate what happens when [we add the possibility of investing in a risk-free asset]{.blue}

-   As you'll see, when you add the risk-free asset, the implication is that [there should only be only one efficient portfolio!]{.blue}

## Risk-Free Saving and Borrowing

-   Assume that you have a risk-free asset, such as a Treasury Bill, where the return is $R_f$ and, by definition, has no risk
-   You decided to invest a portion $x$ of your holdings in the risky portfolio, and the remaining $1-x$ in the risk-free asset
-   The expected return from your new portfolio, which we'll call $R_{C}$, is:

. . .

$$E[R_{C}] =  x \times E[R_p] + (1-x) \times R_f $$

-   Rearranging terms, we have that:

. . .

$$
\small E[R_{C}] =  x \times E[R_p] + R_f - x \times R_f\rightarrow R_f + x \times ( E[R_p] - R_f )
$$

## Risk-Free Saving and Borrowing, continued

-   Therefore, the expected return of a portfolio that contains risky assets and a risk-free asset is defined as:

$$
\small E[R_{C}] =  R_f + x \times ( E[R_p] - R_f )
$$

-   This equation shows that the expected return of your portfolio is the sum of:
    1.  The risk-free rate; and
    2.  A fraction of the portfolio's risk premium, $E[R_p] - R_f$, based on the fraction $x$ that we invest in it
    3.  A risk-premium is nothing more than the reward for bearing additional risk
-   In other words, if you increase $x$, your expected gains should increase because you're more exposed to risk!

## Risk-Free Saving and Borrowing, continued

-   What happens to the volatility of a portfolio when you add the possibility of a risk-free asset?

-   Remember that the risk free rate is assumed to have no risk, and therefore its variance is zero. As a consequence, the standard deviation of your portfolio that contains risky and risk-free assets is:

. . .

$$\small \sigma_{R_{C}} = \sqrt{(1-x)^2 \times \sigma^2(R_f) + x^2 \times \sigma^2(R_p)  + 2 \times(1-x) \times x \times Cov(R_f, R_p)}$$

-   Because $\small \sigma^2{R_f}=0$, this simplifies to:

. . .

$$\sigma(R_{C}) = \sqrt{x^2 \times \sigma^2(R_p)}\rightarrow x \times \sigma(R_p)$$

-   That is,[the volatility is only a fraction of the volatility of the portfolio]{.blue}, based on the amount we invest in it.

## Risk-Free Saving and Borrowing

-   Remember that you can have short positions (*"buying stocks on margin"*)

    1.  If you borrow at the $R_f$ to invest in a portfolio, you have a levered position.
    2.  You are investing more than 100% of your funds in the portolio. The weight is higher than 1.

-   To identify the tangent portfolio, we compute the Sharpe ratio.

$$Sharpe\;ratio = \frac{E[R_p]-R_f}{Sd(R_p)}$$

-   To earn the highest possible expected return for any level of volatility we must find the portfolio that generates the steepest (highest inclination) possible line when combined with the risk-free investment.

-   The optimal portfolio to combine with the risk-free asset will be the one with the highest Sharpe ratio, where the line with the risk-free investment just touches, and so is tangent to, the efficient frontier of risky investments

-   The Sharpe ratio measures the ratio of reward-to-volatility provided by a portfolio.

## Risk-Free Saving and Borrowing

1.  Fact 1: The tangent portfolio is efficient.

2.  Fact 2: Once we include the risk-free investment, all efficient portfolios are combinations of the risk-free investment and the tangent portfolio.

-   All investors should have the tangent portfolio. All investors should combine the tangent portfolio with the risk free asset to adjust the level of risk.

-   If you ignore the risk free asset, you have several efficient portfolios (efficient frontier). But once you combine with the risk free rate, there is only one.

# Efficient Port. and Required Returns

## Efficient Port. and Required Returns

-   Let's now consider how much return we will demand from a risky asset in order to make its inclusion in our portfolio worthy

-   Let's say that you hold an arbitrary portfolio P (it does not matter what is inside P for the moment).

-   You only include an additional asset if it excess return to the level of risk, right? That is, if it increases the Sharpe ratio of the resulting portfolio (Portfolio P + New asset)

-   What is the excess return that this asset *i* brings to your portfolio P?

$E[R_i] - R_f$ (quite simple!)

-   Now, what is the risk that this asset *i* brings to your portfolio P?

$Sd(R_i) \times corr(R_i,R_p)$

## Efficient Port. and Required Returns

-   So now our question is: is the gain in return from investing in *i* adequate to make up for the increase in risk?

-   To see that, we have to test if (because the right-hand part is the level of return-to-risk we already have in P).

$$\frac{E[R_i] - R_f}{Sd(R_i) \times corr(R_i,R_p)} > \frac{E[R_p] - R_f}{Sd(R_p)}$$

-   Moving the denominator to the right-hand side:

$$E[R_i] - R_f > Sd(R_i) \times corr(R_i,R_p) \times \frac{E[R_p] - R_f}{Sd(R_p)}$$

## Efficient Port. and Required Returns

$$E[R_i] - R_f > \frac{Sd(R_i) \times corr(R_i,R_p)}{Sd(R_p)}  \times (E[R_p] - R_f)$$

-   Using a Beta notation:

$$E[R_i] - R_f > \beta_i^P  \times (E[R_p] - R_f)$$

-   $$E[R_i]  >  R_f + \beta_i^P  \times (E[R_p] - R_f)$$

## Efficient Port. and Required Returns

-   That is, increasing the amount invested in i will increase the Sharpe ratio of portfolio P if its expected return $E[R_i]$ exceeds its required return given portfolio P, defined as

$$R_i =  R_f + \beta_i^P  \times (E[R_p] - R_f)$$

## Efficient Port. and Required Returns

-   The required return is the expected return that is necessary to compensate for the risk investment i will contribute to the portfolio.

-   The required return for an investment *i* is equal to the risk-free interest rate plus the risk premium of the current portfolio, P, scaled by *i*'s sensitivity to P, which is $\beta_i^P$.

-   If *i*'s expected return exceeds this required return, then adding more of it will improve the performance of the portfolio.

## Efficient Port. and Required Returns

-   This equation establishes the relation between an investment's risk and its expected return.

-   It states that we can determine the appropriate risk premium for an investment from its beta with the efficient portfolio.

$$R_i =  R_f + \beta_i^P  \times (E[R_p] - R_f)$$

# The CAPM

## The CAPM

-   This is perhaps the most important model in Finance. Three main assumptions:

    1.  Investors can buy and sell all securities at competitive market prices (without incurring taxes or transactions costs) and can borrow and lend at the risk-free interest rate.

    2.  Investors hold only efficient portfolios of traded securities.

    3.  Investors have homogeneous expectations regarding the volatilities, correlations, and expected returns of securities. There is no information asymmetry

-   If investors have homogeneous expectations, they will identify the same efficient portfolio (the highest Sharpe).

-   Under the CAPM assumptions, we can identify the efficient portfolio: It is equal to the market portfolio

-   A Market portfolio contains all traded securities in a economy

## The CAPM

-   If investors identify the same market portfolio (the highest Sharpe), then we can identify the Capital Market Line (CML).

-   All investors will have a combination of the Market Portfolio and the Rf rate.

<img src="figs/bm_11_11.png" width="90%"/>

# Determining the Risk Premium

## Determining the Risk Premium

-   Under the CAPM assumptions, we can identify the efficient portfolio: It is equal to the market portfolio.

-   Thus, we can change $R_p$ to $R_m$

$$E[R_i] =  R_f + \beta_i  \times (E[R_m] - R_f)$$

-   The beta of a security measures its volatility due to market risk relative to the market as a whole, and thus captures the security's sensitivity to market risk.

## Determining the Risk Premium

-   The Security Market Line: the CAPM implies there is a linear relationship between a stock's Beta and its expected return.

-   This linear relationship has a name: Security Market Line (SML)

## Determining the Risk Premium

![](figs/bm_11_12.png){width="90%"}

# Questions and Final comments

## Question

Imagine that you find the SML in the economy, and you find that two assets lies below it. Would you buy these assets?

<img src="figs/bre13901_0807.jpg" width="100%"/>

## Question

Both assets are expensive. They are offering less return than they are expected to offer according to the CAPM.

Because they are expensive, investors are expected to sell them. So prices are expected to drop.

## Final comments I

The beta of a portfolio is the weighted average beta of the assets in the portfolio.

$$\beta_p = \sum_i x_i \times \beta_i$$

# Appendix


## Proof - Variance of a sum of two random variables

::: callout-tip
### **Theorem I**: the variance of the sum of two random variables equals the sum of the variances of those random variables, plus two times their covariance:

$$
\small
\sigma^2(A+B) = \sigma^2_A + \sigma^2_B + 2\times Cov(A,B) 
$$ **Proof**: variance is defined as:

$$
\small Var(X)=E[(X-E(X))]^2
$$ Therefore, if $X=A+B$, with $A$ and $B$ being two random variables:

$$
\small  Var(X)=Var(A+B) = E[((A+B)-E(A+B))]^2 = E[(\underbrace{[A-E(A)]}_{\text{First Term}}+[\underbrace{B-E(B)}_{\text{Second Term}}])^2] \\
$$ Which is now in the form $\small (A+B)^2=A^2+B^2+2AB$. Using the fact that $E(\cdot)$ is a linear operator, we can apply it to each of the terms:

$$
\small 
= \underbrace{E([A-E(A)]^2}_{\sigma^2_A}+\underbrace{E[B-E(B)]^2}_{\sigma^2_B}+2\times\underbrace{E[A-E(A)][B-E(B)]}_{Cov(A,B)} = \sigma^2_A + \sigma^2_B + 2\times Cov(A,B)\\
$$
:::



## Proof - Variance multiplied by a scalar

::: callout-tip
### **Theorem II**: The variance scales upon multiplication with a constant:

$$
  \sigma^2(\beta \times A ) = \beta^2\times \sigma^2_A 
  $$ **Proof:** define the variance in terms of $\beta$ and $A$:

$$
\sigma^2(\beta\times A)=E[\beta\times A-E(\beta\times A)]^2 \\
$$ Since $\beta$ is a constant, $E[\beta]=\beta$ and we can write:

$$
[\beta\times A - \beta\times E(A)]^2= E[\beta\times (A-E[A])]^2=\beta^2\times \underbrace{E(A-E[A])]^2}_{\sigma^2_A} 
$$ Therefore, whenever there is a scale constant multiplying a random variable, it scales the variance: $\beta^2 \times\sigma^2_A$
:::

## Limits to diversification

-   How much of the variance of a portfolio we can eliminate through diversification? To see that, assume that we hold a portfolio with equal weights $\frac{1}{N}$ to all assets

1.  **In the diagonal**, we have $N$ boxes with $\dfrac{1}{N^2}\times \overline{Var}$, where $\overline{Var}$ is the average variance
2.  **Off the diagonal**, we have $N^2-N$ boxes with $\dfrac{1}{N^2}\times \overline{Cov}$, where $\overline{Cov}$ is the average covariance

-   Therefere, you can rearrange terms to get:

. . .

$$
\small Var(R_p) = \bigg(N\times\dfrac{1}{N^2}\times \overline{Var}\bigg)+ \bigg[(N^2-N)\dfrac{1}{N^2}\times \overline{Cov}\bigg]\\
\small = \bigg(\frac{1}{N} \times \overline{Var}\bigg) + \bigg[\bigg(1-\frac{1}{N}\bigg) \times \overline{Cov}\bigg]
$$

## Limits to diversification, continued

-   What happens if $N\rightarrow\infty$? If you look at our equation, you'll see that [only the covariance terms remain]{.blue}:

. . .

$$
\small \underset{N\rightarrow\infty}{\small Var(R_p)} = \bigg(\frac{1}{\infty} \times \overline{Var}\bigg) + \bigg[\bigg(1-\frac{1}{\infty}\bigg) \times \overline{Cov}\bigg]\rightarrow \overline{Cov}
$$

## Volatility of a large portfolio with arbitrary weights

-   What if we don't have an equally-weighted portfolio? As $N$ increases, you can rewrite the variance of the portfolio[^1] as:

[^1]: See @BDM, pg. 409 for a detailed explanation.

. . .

$$\small \sigma^2_{R_p} = \sum_i w_i \times Cov(R_i,R_p)$$

-   The variance of a portfolio approaches the [weighted average covariance of each stock with the portfolio]{.blue}!

-   Because $\small Cov(R_i,R_P) = \sigma_i \times \sigma_p \times Corr_{i,p}$) you can also write it as:

. . .

$$\sigma^2_{R_p} = \sum_i x_i \times \sigma_{i} \times \sigma_{p} \times Corr_{i,p}$$

## Volatility of a large portfolio with arbitrary weights

-   If we divide both sides of this equation by $\sigma_{p}$, we find:

. . .

$$\sigma_{p} = \sum_i x_i \times \sigma_{i}  \times Corr(R_i,R_p)$$
