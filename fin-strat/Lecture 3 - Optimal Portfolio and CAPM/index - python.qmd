# From Assets to Portfolios

## The Expected Return of a two-stock portfolio

-   Previously, we looked at returns from [individual]{.blue} assets, but investors are always looking for ways to invest in [multiple]{.blue} assets at the same time. What if you hold a [portfolio]{.blue} of $n$ assets?

-   Let's keep it simple for now. Suppose you have a two-stock [portfolio]{.blue} of assets that consists of:

    1.  [Amazon (AMZN)]{.blue} 40% of the portfolio, 10% return and standard deviation (volatility) of 26.6%
    2.  [Southwest (LUV)]{.blue}: 60% of the portfolio, 15% return and stardard deviation (volatility) of 27.9%

-   If your portfolio is 40% [Amazon]{.blue} and 60% [Southwest]{.blue}, then the return of your portfolio, $R_p$ is:

. . .

$$\small R_p= \sum_{i=1}^{2}\big(x_i\times R_i\big)=(0.4 \times 10\%) +(0.6 \times 15\%) = 13\%$$

. . .

*$\rightarrow$ In other words, the return of a portfolio is the weighted average of the individual asset returns!*

## The Expected Return of a two-stock portfolio, continued

::: callout-important
### Important

The weights are selected by the investors and may change over time if the prices change (unless the investor actively rebalances it to match the same proportion by buying/selling). Without trading, the weights increase for those stocks whose returns exceed the portfolioâ€™s return.
:::

-   To see that, assume that your initial holdings are \$100,000:

    1.  If [Amazon]{.blue} is 40% of the portfolio with a 10% return $\small \rightarrow 40,000\times (1+10\%)=44,000$
    2.  [Southwest]{.blue}: 60% of the portfolio with a 15% return $\small \rightarrow 60,000\times (1+15\%)=69,000$

-   Your holdings are now worth $\small 44,000 + 69,000= 113,000$, which yields the 13% return, but now the weights from each stock are different:

    1.  [Amazon]{.blue} holdings are $\small \frac{44}{113}\approx 38.9\%$ of the portfolio
    2.  [Southwest]{.blue} holdings are $\small \frac{69}{113}\approx 61.1\%$ of the portfolio

## Volatility of a two-stock portfolio

-   As we now have a portfolio of two different assets, what should be the volatility? Recall that:

    1.  [Amazon (AMZN)]{.blue}'s standard deviation (volatility) is 26.6%
    2.  [Southwest (LUV)]{.blue}'s stardard deviation (volatility) of 27.9%

-   As we'll see in the next slides, to compute the standard deviation of a portfolio, [we cannot rely on the weighted average]{.blue} anymore!

-   In order to see that, let's look at the historical prices from both stocks and compare:

    1.  The price trend from [Amazon]{.blue}
    2.  The price trend from [Southwest]{.blue}
    3.  The dollar holdings for a portfolio of \$1 that holds 40% [Amazon]{.blue} and 60% [Southwest]{.blue}

-   In what follows, we'll see how these dynamics shed light on the covariance of the portfolio

- If we were to do a weighted average of the individual volatilities, it would be around $18.6$

- On the other hand, our portfolio show a volatility of $\small 16.5$, which is $\small \approx -11.2\%$ lower




## Volatility of a two-stock portfolio, continued

1.  $\sigma^2_1$ = variance of Asset 1.
2.  $\sigma^2_2$ = variance of Asset 2
3.  $\sigma_{1,2}$ = covariance between Assets 1 and 2

## Volatility of a 2-stock portfolio

-   Covariance is the product of the assets' standard deviations and and their correlation:

. . .

$$\sigma_{12} = \sigma_1 \times \sigma_2 \times \rho_{12}$$

-   Covariance is the expected product of the deviations of two returns from their means.

. . .

$$Cov(R_i,R_j) = E[(R_i-E[R_i]) \times (R_j-E[R_j]) ]$$

-   When using historical data:

. . .

$$Cov(R_i,R_j) = \frac{1}{T-1} (R_i-\tilde{R_i} ) \times (R_j-\tilde{R_j} )$$

## Volatility of a 2-stock portfolio

-   Correlation:

. . .

$$Corr(R_i,R_j) = \frac{Cov(R_i,R_j)}{Sd(R_i)\times  Sd(R_j)  }$$

-   Therefore, the portfolio variance is:

. . .

$$var = (x_1^2 \times \sigma_1^2)  + (x_2^2 \times \sigma_2^2) + 2(x_1 \times x_2 \times \sigma_1 \times \sigma_2 \times \rho_{12})$$

-   For example, if $\rho_{12} = 0.26$

-   $$(0.4^2 \times 26.6^2)  + (0.6^2 \times 27.9^2) + 2(0.4 \times 0.6 \times 26.6 \times 27.9 \times 0.26) = 486.1$$

-   The standard deviation of the portfolio is $\sqrt{486.1}= 22\%$, which is lower than 26.6% and 27.9%.

## Volatility of a 2-stock portfolio

-   Covariance and Correlation

-   Let's remember the basics about correlation.

![](figs/bm_11_1.png)

## Volatility of a 2-stock portfolio

-   Covariance and Correlation

-   These assets have the same historical return and volatility, but they 'move' very differently:

-   For example, when North Air performed well, Text Oil tended to do poorly, and when North Air did poorly, Text oil tended to do well

-   North Air is not positively correlated with Text Oil.

-   Consider the portfolio which consists of equal investments in West Air and Tex Oil. The average return of the portfolio is equal to the average return of the two stocks...

-   ...However, the volatility of 5.1% is much less than the volatility of the two individual stocks.

-   The amount of risk that is eliminated in a portfolio depends on the degree to which the stocks face common risks and their prices move together.

## Volatility of a 2-stock portfolio

-   If you don't remember how to calculate manually the correlation, please take a look at the notes of your statistics lectures.

# Volatility of a large portfolio

## Volatility of a large portfolio

![](figs/bre13901_0713.jpg)

## Volatility of a large portfolio

-   The variance of a three-asset portfolio can be built using a previous slide...

. . .

$$var = (x_1^2 \times \sigma_1^2)  + (x_2^2 \times \sigma_2^2) + 2(x_1 \times x_2 \times \sigma_1 \times \sigma_2 \times \rho_{12})$$

... plus the following terms.

. . .

$$+ (x_3^2 \times \sigma_3^2) + 2(x_1 \times x_3 \times \sigma_1 \times \sigma_3 \times \rho_{13}) +  2(x_2 \times x_3 \times \sigma_2 \times \sigma_3 \times \rho_{23})$$

## Volatility of a large portfolio

-   Note in the previous figure: as the number N of assets increases, the number of terms outside the main diagonal increases more than the main diagonal.

-   Therefore, the variance of a well-diversified portfolio mostly contains covariances.

-   For a portfolio with equal weights to all assets, We can write that:

. . .

$$Var(R_p) = \frac{1}{N} \times average\;variance + (1-\frac{1}{N}) \times average \; covariance$$

-   As N grows to infinite, only the average covariance lasts.

## Volatility of a large portfolio

-   So, if you increase the size of your portfolio, the risk decreases (until to a certain amount).

-   Usually, you can diversify about half of the initial variance.

![](figs/bm_fig_11_2.jpg)

## Volatility of a large portfolio

-   You can also write that

. . .

$$Var(R_p) = \sum_i x_i \times Cov(R_i,R_p)$$

-   This equation indicates that the variance of a portfolio is equal to the weighted average covariance of each stock with the portfolio.

-   This expression reveals that the risk of a portfolio depends on how each stockâ€™s return moves in relation to it.

-   Additionally, notice that stocks can have different weights in this equation (the previous example assumed equal weights).

## Volatility of a large portfolio

-   The equation in the previous slide can also be written as (remember that $Cov = sd \times sd \times corr$):

.. .

$$Var(R_p) = \sum_i x_i \times Sd(R_i) \times Sd(R_p) \times Corr(R_i,R_p)$$

-   If we divide both sides of this equation by $Sd(R_p)$, we find:

. . .

$$Sd(R_p) = \sum_i x_i \times Sd(R_i)  \times Corr(R_i,R_p)$$

-   This equation shows the amount of risk that each security brings to portfolio. Each asset *i* contributes to the portfolio's volatility according to its Sd scaled by its correlation with the portfolio.

## Volatility of a large portfolio

-   In these graphs, I am assuming that you can invest a negative amount in a stock. This is called a short position. When you buy, you have a long position.

-   Short sales are usually allowed if you provide enough security and collateral to the market.

-   The idea is that you think that a stock's price will go down so you sell it. Later, you buy it back (but if the price goes up, you lose part of your investment).

-   Notice that if you can short sale, you amplify the pairs return-risk available.

# Choosing an Efficient Portfolio

## Choosing an Efficient Portfolio

-   Now, you can understand what an efficient portfolio is.
    1.  It is the portfolio that brings the higher return for any given level of risk
    2.  Or a portfolio that brings the lower risk for any given return.

## Choosing an Efficient Portfolio

-   As a financial manager, one crucial job you have is to find the efficient portfolios and the minimum variance portfolio.

![](figs/bm_11_4.png)

## Choosing an Efficient Portfolio

-   If you add stocks you improve the frontier

-   When you combine several assets, you will have what is called efficient frontier.

![](figs/bm_11_8.png)

## Choosing an Efficient Portfolio

# Risk-Free Saving and Borrowing

## Risk-Free Saving and Borrowing

-   Thus far, we have considered the risk and return possibilities that result from combining risky investments into portfolios.

-   By including all risky investments in the construction of the efficient frontier, we achieve the maximum diversification possible with risky assets.

-   Now, let's see what happens when you combine a portfolio of risky assets with the risk free asset.

## Risk-Free Saving and Borrowing

-   The return is:

. . .

$$E[R_{px}] =  x \times E[R_p] + (1-x) \times R_f $$

$x$ is the weight invested in the portfolio:

. . .

-   Which leads to:

. . .

$$E[R_{px}] =  x \times E[R_p] + R_f - x \times R_f $$

. . .

$$E[R_{px}] =  R_f + x \times ( E[R_p] - R_f ) $$

-   The second equation shows that: The expected return is equal to the risk-free rate plus a fraction of the portfolioâ€™s risk premium, $E[R_p] - R_f$, based on the fraction x that we invest in it.

## Risk-Free Saving and Borrowing

-   Remember that the risk free rate is assumed to have no risk, thus no variance. The standard deviation is:

$$Sd(R_{px}) = \sqrt{(1-x)^2 \times Var(R_f) + x^2 \times Var(R_p)  + 2 \times(1-x) \times x \times Cov(R_f, R_p)}$$

-   Which leads to

$$Sd(R_{px}) = \sqrt{x^2 \times Var(R_p)}$$

$$Sd(R_{px}) = x \times Sd(R_p)$$

-   That is, the volatility is only a fraction of the volatility of the portfolio, based on the amount we invest in it.

## Risk-Free Saving and Borrowing

-   Remember that you can have short positions (*"buying stocks on margin"*)
    1.  If you borrow at the Rf to invest in a portfolio, you have a levered position.
    2.  You are investing more than 100% of your funds in the portolio. The weight is higher than 1.
-   To identify the tangent portfolio, we compute the Sharpe ratio.

$$Sharpe\;ratio = \frac{E[R_p]-R_f}{Sd(R_p)}$$

-   To earn the highest possible expected return for any level of volatility we must find the portfolio that generates the steepest (highest inclination) possible line when combined with the risk-free investment.

-   The optimal portfolio to combine with the risk-free asset will be the one with the highest Sharpe ratio, where the line with the risk-free investment just touches, and so is tangent to, the efficient frontier of risky investments

-   The Sharpe ratio measures the ratio of reward-to-volatility provided by a portfolio.

## Risk-Free Saving and Borrowing

1.  Fact 1: The tangent portfolio is efficient.

2.  Fact 2: Once we include the risk-free investment, all efficient portfolios are combinations of the risk-free investment and the tangent portfolio.

-   All investors should have the tangent portfolio. All investors should combine the tangent portfolio with the risk free asset to adjust the level of risk.

-   If you ignore the risk free asset, you have several efficient portfolios (efficient frontier). But once you combine with the risk free rate, there is only one.

# Efficient Port. and Required Returns

## Efficient Port. and Required Returns

-   Let's now consider how much return we will demand from a risky asset in order to make its inclusion in our portfolio worthy

-   Let's say that you hold an arbitrary portfolio P (it does not matter what is inside P for the moment).

-   You only include an additional asset if it excess return to the level of risk, right? That is, if it increases the Sharpe ratio of the resulting portfolio (Portfolio P + New asset)

-   What is the excess return that this asset *i* brings to your portfolio P?

$E[R_i] - R_f$ (quite simple!)

-   Now, what is the risk that this asset *i* brings to your portfolio P?

$Sd(R_i) \times corr(R_i,R_p)$

## Efficient Port. and Required Returns

-   So now our question is: is the gain in return from investing in *i* adequate to make up for the increase in risk?

-   To see that, we have to test if (because the right-hand part is the level of return-to-risk we already have in P).

$$\frac{E[R_i] - R_f}{Sd(R_i) \times corr(R_i,R_p)} > \frac{E[R_p] - R_f}{Sd(R_p)}$$

-   Moving the denominator to the right-hand side:

$$E[R_i] - R_f > Sd(R_i) \times corr(R_i,R_p) \times \frac{E[R_p] - R_f}{Sd(R_p)}$$

## Efficient Port. and Required Returns

$$E[R_i] - R_f > \frac{Sd(R_i) \times corr(R_i,R_p)}{Sd(R_p)}  \times (E[R_p] - R_f)$$

-   Using a Beta notation:

$$E[R_i] - R_f > \beta_i^P  \times (E[R_p] - R_f)$$

-   $$E[R_i]  >  R_f + \beta_i^P  \times (E[R_p] - R_f)$$

## Efficient Port. and Required Returns

-   That is, increasing the amount invested in i will increase the Sharpe ratio of portfolio P if its expected return $E[R_i]$ exceeds its required return given portfolio P, defined as

$$R_i =  R_f + \beta_i^P  \times (E[R_p] - R_f)$$

## Efficient Port. and Required Returns

-   The required return is the expected return that is necessary to compensate for the risk investment i will contribute to the portfolio.

-   The required return for an investment *i* is equal to the risk-free interest rate plus the risk premium of the current portfolio, P, scaled by *i*â€™s sensitivity to P, which is $\beta_i^P$.

-   If *i*â€™s expected return exceeds this required return, then adding more of it will improve the performance of the portfolio.

## Efficient Port. and Required Returns

-   This equation establishes the relation between an investmentâ€™s risk and its expected return.

-   It states that we can determine the appropriate risk premium for an investment from its beta with the efficient portfolio.

$$R_i =  R_f + \beta_i^P  \times (E[R_p] - R_f)$$

# The CAPM

## The CAPM

-   This is perhaps the most important model in Finance. Three main assumptions:

    1.  Investors can buy and sell all securities at competitive market prices (without incurring taxes or transactions costs) and can borrow and lend at the risk-free interest rate.

    2.  Investors hold only efficient portfolios of traded securities.

    3.  Investors have homogeneous expectations regarding the volatilities, correlations, and expected returns of securities. There is no information asymmetry

-   If investors have homogeneous expectations, they will identify the same efficient portfolio (the highest Sharpe).

-   Under the CAPM assumptions, we can identify the efficient portfolio: It is equal to the market portfolio

-   A Market portfolio contains all traded securities in a economy

## The CAPM

-   If investors identify the same market portfolio (the highest Sharpe), then we can identify the Capital Market Line (CML).

-   All investors will have a combination of the Market Portfolio and the Rf rate.

# Determining the Risk Premium

## Determining the Risk Premium

-   Under the CAPM assumptions, we can identify the efficient portfolio: It is equal to the market portfolio.

-   Thus, we can change $R_p$ to $R_m$

$$E[R_i] =  R_f + \beta_i  \times (E[R_m] - R_f)$$

-   The beta of a security measures its volatility due to market risk relative to the market as a whole, and thus captures the securityâ€™s sensitivity to market risk.

## Determining the Risk Premium

-   The Security Market Line: the CAPM implies there is a linear relationship between a stock's Beta and its expected return.

-   This linear relationship has a name: Security Market Line (SML)

## Determining the Risk Premium

![](figs/bm_11_12.png){width="90%"}

# Questions and Final comments

## Question

Imagine that you find the SML in the economy, and you find that two assets lies below it. Would you buy these assets?

<img src="figs/bre13901_0807.jpg" width="100%"/>

## Question

Both assets are expensive. They are offering less return than they are expected to offer according to the CAPM.

Because they are expensive, investors are expected to sell them. So prices are expected to drop.

## Final comments I

The beta of a portfolio is the weighted average beta of the assets in the portfolio.

$$\beta_p = \sum_i x_i \times \beta_i$$
