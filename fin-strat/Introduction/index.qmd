## Overview

-   Financial agents are constantly making strategic decisions trying to balance the trade-off between *risk* and *return*:

    1.  How many assets should I hold on my portfolio?
    2.  How much holdings from risky assets should I hold in my portfolio?
    3.  How can I fund profitable investment opportunities from my company?

-   In this course, we'll look at two sets of strategic decisions that financial agents (*e.g*, CFOs, Portfolio Managers) make:

    1.  The [first part]{.blue} will be focused at looking from a [portfolio manager]{.blue} view: if you have the money and need to allocate it across a set of potential assets, how should you do it?

    2.  The second part (after the mid-term) will be more focused on [corporate finance]{.blue} decisions: if you have a good investment opportunity, how can you fund it, and What are the implications for the value of your company?

## Getting the best of this course, continued

. . .

**Studying for examinations**

1.  I highly recommend using [Prof. Henrique Martins (FGV-EAESP)](https://henriquemartins.net/) materiais. In his website, there are suggested exercises for each lecture of our course.

. . .

$\rightarrow$ *To access, click [here](https://henriquemartins.net/teaching/financial_strategy/) - I'll also refer to the specific links for each part of the content at the beginning of each lecture*

2.  In the *Syllabus*, you can find a list of recommended exercises from our main text-book, [@BDM]. Note that these are not mandatory but rather serve as a way for your to practice

3.  Use the handout as an opportunity to motivate your studies through real-world examples. These handouts will focus not only on providing you with a sense of how useful this is in a real-world application, but also can definitely help you better understand the mechanics behind everytine that we'll study throughout the course!
