              textbook for courses in investment analysis. Our guiding
              principle has been to present the material in a framework that is
              organized by a central core of consistent funda-mental
              principles. We attempt to strip away unnecessary mathematical and
              technical detail, and we have concen-trated on providing the
              intuition that may guide students and practitioners as they
              confront new ideas and chal-lenges in their professional
              lives''--",
